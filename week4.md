## Some things to keep in mind

### Rubocop

Remember to use Rubocop to check that all your future code still follows the configured style rules.

If you are using Visual Studio Code, consider installing the [ruby-rubocop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=misogi.ruby-rubocop) plugin.

### Issues with forms

In week 2 we modified the beer creation form so that the style and the brewery of the new beer are chosen from a dropdown menu. We modified the form to use _select_ instead of a text field:

```ruby
<div>
  <%= form.label :style, style: "display: block" %>
  <%= form.select :style, options_for_select(@styles) %>
</div>

<div>
  <%= form.label :brewery_id, style: "display: block" %>
  <%= form.select :brewery_id, options_from_collection_for_select(@breweries, :id, :name) %>
</div>
```

the selection options of dropdown menus are sent to the form through the variables <code>@styles</code> and <code>@breweries</code>, and their values are set by the controller method <code>new</code>:

```ruby
def new
  @beer = Beer.new
  @breweries = Brewery.all
  @styles = ["Weizen", "Lager", "Pale ale", "IPA", "Porter", "Lowalcohol"]
end
```

Interestingly after these changes, editing a beer information will stop working. It causes the error message <code>undefined method `map' for nil:NilClass</code>, which you have probably already encountered in the course:

![picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2022/main/images/ratebeer-w4-0.png)

The reason for this is that creating a new beer and editing a beer require the use of the same view template to generate the form (app/views/beers/_form.html.erb). Also after the changes, the view requires that the variable <code>@breweries</code> contains a list of the breweries and that the variable <code>styles</code> contains the beers styles. You access the beer editing page by executing the <code>edit</code> controller method, and you will have to fix the controller like shown below, if you want to fix the issue:

```ruby
def edit
  @breweries = Brewery.all
  @styles = ["Weizen", "Lager", "Pale ale", "IPA", "Porter", "Lowalcohol"]
end
```

You will find exactly the same problem if you try to create a beer which is not valid. In such case, the controller method <code>create</code> is the one which tries to render the view template which generates the form again. In fact, you will have to set a value to the variables <code>@style</code> and <code>@breweries</code> which need a template before rendering the page.

```ruby
def create
  @beer = Beer.new(beer_params)

  respond_to do |format|
    if @beer.save
      format.html { redirect_to beers_path, notice: 'Beer was successfully created.' }
      format.json { render action: 'show', status: :created, location: @beer }
    else
      @breweries = Brewery.all
      @styles = ["Weizen", "Lager", "Pale ale", "IPA", "Porter"]

      format.html { render action: 'new' }
      format.json { render json: @beer.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end
```

It's typical that the controller methods <code>new</code>, <code>create</code> and <code>edit</code> contain much of the same code, which is used to initiate the variables which view templates need. The best thing you can do is extracting the similar code into a method:

```ruby
def set_breweries_and_styles_for_template
  @breweries = Brewery.all
  @styles = ["Weizen", "Lager", "Pale ale", "IPA", "Porter", "Lowalcohol"]
end
```

The method can be called from the controller methods <code>new</code>, <code>create</code> and <code>edit</code>:

```ruby
def new
  @beer = Beer.new
  set_breweries_and_styles_for_template
end
```

 or you could do it with the <code>before_action</code> expression, which looks even better:

```ruby
class BeersController < ApplicationController
  # ...
  before_action :set_breweries_and_styles_for_template, only: [:new, :edit, :create]

  # ...
```

in this way, the method to set the values of the variables <code>@styles</code> and <code>@breweries</code> is executed authomatically always before executing the methods <code>new</code>, <code>create</code> and <code>edit</code>. We might not need to set the variables values in the method <code>create</code> because they are needed only in case the validation fails. It might have made sense to use an explicit call in create.

### Problems with Heroku or Fly.io

Many students in the course have met problems with Heroku where sometimes an application which was working perfectly locally has caused the same old, annoying error message in Heroku, _We're sorry, but something went wrong_.

The thing to do right in the beginning is making sure all the code has been added from the local computer to the version management, that is <code>git status</code>!

Non-trivial problems are always solved using Heroku's logs. You can inspect logs through the command <code>heroku logs</code> for Heroku and <code>fly logs</code> for Fly.io, from the command line

You find the log of a typical problem (in Heroku) below:

```

if you read the logs carefully, you will find the reason is the following

```ruby
ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid (PG::UndefinedTable: ERROR:  relation "users" does not exist
```

you haven't executed the migrations. Fixing this will be easy:

    heroku run rails db:migrate

Fly.io executes migrations automatically, so most likely you won't run into the above problem there.

You find the log of another typical error (also in Fly.io) situation below:

```ruby

2022-08-28T19:32:31.609715+00:00 app[web.1]:    10:
```

The error was _ActionView::Template::Error (undefined method \`username' for nil:NilClass)_  and it was happened while executing line 7 in file _app/views/ratings/index.html.erb_ .

The line which caused the problem:

```ruby
<li> <%= rating %> <%= link_to rating.user.username, rating.user %> </li>
```

It seems that in the database there is a `rating` object whose associated user is `nil`. We already met this issue in [week 2](https://github.com/mluukkai/webdevelopment-rails/blob/main/week2.md#problems-with-heroku).

The reason behind this is either a <code>nil</code> value for the <code>user_id</code> field of a rating, or an erroneous ID. One of the ways to solve the issue is destroying the 'bad' rating objects from the console. Heroku console opens with <code>heroku run console</code> and Fly.io with first running <code>fly ssh console</code> and then <code>/app/bin/rails c</code>.


```ruby
> bad_ratings = Rating.all.select{ |r| r.user.nil? or r.beer.nil? }
=> [#<Rating id: 1, score: 10, beer_id: 2, created_at: "2022-08-28 19:04:43", updated_at: "2022-08-28 19:04:43", user_id: nil>]
> bad_ratings.each{ |bad| bad.destroy }
=> [#<Rating id: 1, score: 10, beer_id: 2, created_at: "2022-08-28 19:04:43", updated_at: "2022-08-28 19:04:43", user_id: nil>]
> Rating.all.select{ |r| r.user.nil? or r.beer.nil? }
=> []
>
```

The commands above retrieve also the ratings that don't belong to any beer.

So if you have troubles with Heroku or Fly.io, find out where is the problem: logs and console will always help you out!


### Cancelling a migration

Sometimes you may want to cancel a migration you just executed – for instance if you create a bad scaffold, see the following section. This is possible through the command

    rails db:rollback

### Bad scaffold

If you want to remove the files created by the scaffold generator, you can do it with the command

    rails destroy scaffold resource_name

where _resource_name_ is the name of the resource you created with scaffold. **ATTENTION:** if you executed a bad scaffold migration already, you should definitely do <code>rails db:rollback</code> before using scaffold destroy.


## Testing

So far, we have only tested our code in the browser. This is a great mistake. Every program which is supposed to last for long should include an ample range of automatic tests, otherwise expanding the program will be too risky.

You can use Rspec for tests, see http://rspec.info/,  https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails and http://betterspecs.org/

Get started with rspec-rails gem by adding the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  # ...
  gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 6.0.0.rc1'
end
```

> At the moment of writing, the only available version of rspec-rails 6 ends in .rc1. The repository of the rspec project recommends using version 6.0.0 which might start working agin during the course.

You can set up the new gem in the familiar way, executing <code>bundle install</code> from the command line.

You can initialize rspec in your application running the following from command line

    rails generate rspec:install

The initialization creates a folder /spec in the application and the various tests – or specs – will be placed in its subfolders.

According to Rails standard but currently less common testing framework, the test are place in the folder /test. The folder will be useless after taking rspec and you can delete it.

The tests – the correct words would be specs or specifications when it comes to rspec, we will be using the word test in the future however – can be written at different levels: unit tests for models and controllers, view tests, and integration tests for controllers. In addition to these, the application can be tested using a simulated browser with the help of the capybara gem https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara.

We will be writing mostly unit tests for models as well as simulated browser-level tests with capybara.

## Unit tests

Let's try out a couple of unit tests for the class <code>User</code>. You can create a test by hand or from the command line with the rspec generator

    rails generate rspec:model user

The file user_spec.rb will appear in the folder /spec/models

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
  pending "add some examples to (or delete) #{__FILE__}"
end
```

Try to run the tests from the command line using the command <code>rspec spec</code> (attention: you might have to restart the terminal at this point!).

The test execution runs like this:

```ruby
$ rspec spec
*

Pending: (Failures listed here are expected and do not affect your suite's status)

  1) User add some examples to (or delete) /Users/mluukkai/opetus/ratebeer/spec/models/user_spec.rb
     # Not yet implemented
     # ./spec/models/user_spec.rb:4


Finished in 0.00932 seconds (files took 3.31 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures, 1 pending
```


The command  <code>rspec spec</code> defines that you execute all the tests which are located inside spec subfolders. If you have a lot of tests, you can also run define the smaller group of tests you want to run:

    rspec spec/models                # executing the tests contained in the models folder
    rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb   # executing the tests defined by user_spect.rb


You can also automate the test execution to run any time a test or the code concerning it changes.
The library used to do this is [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) and there are numerous extensions available for it.

Let's start writing tests. First we'll create a test that tests that the constructor sets the username correctly (this in file _user_spec.rb_):

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
  it "has the username set correctly" do
    user = User.new username: "Pekka"

    expect(user.username).to eq("Pekka")
  end
end
```

The test is written in the code chunk which is given to the method called <code>it</code>. The first parameter of the method is a string, which will act as the test's name. otherwise the test is written in similarly to e.g. jUnit, meaning that the data to test is created first, later the action to test is executed, and at the end the result will be evaluated.

Execute the test and we see that it goes through:

```ruby
$ rspec spec

Finished in 0.00553 seconds (files took 2.11 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures
```

Differently from the jUnit testing framework, Rspecs don't make use of assert commands to evaluate the result. They make use of a more particular syntax, as the last test line shows:

    expect(user.username).to eq("Pekka")

In the test you have just run, you used the command <code>new</code> so the object was not save in the database. Try to store the object now. You defined that User objects have a password whose length is over 4 and that contains at least one digit and one uppercase letter. So if the password is not set up, the object should not be stored in the database. 

Test this:


```ruby
RSpec.describe User, type: :model do

  # previously written test code...

  it "is not saved without a password" do
    user = User.create username: "Pekka"

    expect(user.valid?).to be(false)
    expect(User.count).to eq(0)
  end
end
```

The test goes smoothly.

The first validation in the test

```ruby
expect(user.valid?).to be(false)
```

is understandably. Thanks to rspec magic power, it can also be expressed like this.

```ruby
expect(user).not_to be_valid
```

This form is based on the fact the object <code>user</code> has the method <code>valid?</code> which returns a true-false value.

We notice that we are using two ways to check equality in tests: <code>be(false)</code> ja <code>eq(0)</code>. What is the difference between the two? The matcher <code>be</code> can help you to check if two objects are the same. When comparing true-false values, <code>be</code> is a useful matcher. It will not work with strings, for instance. Try to change the comparison of the first test:

```ruby
expect(user.username).to be("Pekka")
```

the test will not go through now:

```ruby
1) User has the username set correctly
    Failure/Error: expect(user.username).to be("Pekka")

      expected #<String:70322613325340> => "Pekka"
          got #<String:70322613325560> => "Pekka"

      Compared using equal?, which compares object identity,
      but expected and actual are not the same object. Use
      `expect(actual).to eq(expected)` if you don't care about
      object identity in this example.
```

When it is enough that the content of two objects is the same, you will have to use <code>eq</code>, which applies to most of the situations except when it comes to true-false values. Though, you could use <code>eq</code> even with true-false values, writing


```ruby
expect(user.valid?).to eq(false)
```

Make a test with a proper password

```ruby
it "is saved with a proper password" do
  user = User.create username: "Pekka", password: "Secret1", password_confirmation: "Secret1"

  expect(user.valid?).to be(true)
  expect(User.count).to eq(1)
end
```

The first test "expectation" makes sure the new object validation is successful, so the method <code>valid?</code> will return true. The second expectation will make sure that there is one object in the database.

You could have used another form which can be read even more easily for the user validation:

```ruby
expect(user).to be_valid
```

You have to consider that rspec **will always reset the database after running each test**, so if you do a new test where you need Pekka, you have to create him again:

```ruby
it "with a proper password and two ratings, has the correct average rating" do
  user = User.create username: "Pekka", password: "Secret1", password_confirmation: "Secret1"
  brewery = Brewery.new name: "test", year: 2000
  beer = Beer.new name: "testbeer", style: "teststyle", brewery: brewery
  rating = Rating.new score: 10, beer: beer
  rating2 = Rating.new score: 20, beer: beer

  user.ratings << rating
  user.ratings << rating2

  expect(user.ratings.count).to eq(2)
  expect(user.average_rating).to eq(15.0)
end
```

As you might have guessed, it is not smart to initiate a test object various times, and the part in common can be extracted. You can do this by adding a <code>describe</code> chunk for each test containing the same initialization and defining a <code>let</code> command at the beginning of the chunk. The command will be executed before each test and it will initialize again a user variable each time:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe User, type: :model do
  it "has the username set correctly" do
    user = User.new username: "Pekka"

    expect(user.username).to eq("Pekka")
  end

  it "is not saved without a password" do
    user = User.create username: "Pekka"

    expect(user).not_to be_valid
    expect(User.count).to eq(0)
  end

  describe "with a proper password" do
    let(:user){ User.create username: "Pekka", password: "Secret1", password_confirmation: "Secret1" }
    let(:test_brewery) { Brewery.new name: "test", year: 2000 }
    let(:test_beer) { Beer.create name: "testbeer", style: "teststyle", brewery: test_brewery }

    it "is saved" do
      expect(user).to be_valid
      expect(User.count).to eq(1)
    end

    it "and with two ratings, has the correct average rating" do
      rating = Rating.new score: 10, beer: test_beer
      rating2 = Rating.new score: 20, beer: test_beer

      user.ratings << rating
      user.ratings << rating2

      expect(user.ratings.count).to eq(2)
      expect(user.average_rating).to eq(15.0)
    end
  end
end
```

Initializing variables happens with the sligthly peculiar looking <code>let</code> method. E.g.:

```ruby
let(:user){ User.create username: "Pekka", password: "Secret1", password_confirmation: "Secret1" }
```

makes it so that after the definition, the variable _user_ refers to the User object created in the <code>let</code> method's code block.

Even though the variable is initialized only in one part of the code, so far, the initialization will be executed again before each method. Attention: the method <code>let</code> executes the object initialization only when the objec is really needed, this will have unexpected results sometimes!

Especially in older Rspec tests, you will see that the initialization happens through the <code>before :each</code> chunk. In such cases, the variable shared by various tests have to be defined as instance variable, like <code>@user</code>.

The choice of test and describe chunk names was not subject to chance. By defining the result of a test in the "documentation" format (with the -fd parameter), you will be able to print the tests results on the screen in a nice form:

```ruby
$ rspec -fd spec

User
  has the username set correctly
  is not saved without a password
  with a proper password
    is saved
    and with two ratings, has the correct average rating

Finished in 0.12949 seconds (files took 1.95 seconds to load)
4 examples, 0 failures
```

You should aim at writing test names so that executing them will produce "specification" which can be read as easily as possible.

You can also add the line ```-fd``` to the ```.rspec``` file, which will always show the rspec  tests of your project in the documentation format.

> ## Exercise 1
>
> Add tests to the User class to check that no object will be stored in the database if users create a password (with the create method) which is too short or made of letters only. Also, the validation of the new object should not succeed.

Remember to name your tests in a way so that the "spec" produced will sound grammatically appropriate after you run Rspec in the document format.

> ## Exercise 2
>
> Create a test base  with Rspec generator (or by hand) for the class <code>Beer</code> and make tests to check that
> * a beer can be created, and the created beer is stored in the database if the name, brewery, and style of the beer have been set
> * a beer won't be created (that is, no valid object will be brought about by create) if it is not given a name
> * a beer won't be created, if its style hasn't been defined
>
> If the last test does not go through, extend your code so that it will pass the test. Hint: A brewery id needs to be set for a beer but what if no brewery exists?
>
> If you create the test file by hand, remember to place it in the folder spec/models

## Test environments or fixtures

What we did before, creating the object structures for the tests by hand, might not be the best thing to do in some cases. A better way is grouping the structures for the test environment – that is to say the data to initialise the tests – in their own place, a "test fixture". Instead of using Rails standard fixture mechanism to initialize the tests, try the gem called FactoryBot, see
https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot and https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails

Add the following to your Gemfile

```ruby
group :test do
  # ...
  gem 'factory_bot_rails'
end
```

and update the gems with the command <code>bundle install</code>

Create the file spec/factories.rb for your fixtures and write the following:

```ruby
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :user do
    username { "Pekka" }
    password { "Foobar1" }
    password_confirmation { "Foobar1" }
  end
end
```

The file defines an "object factory" for creating objects of `User` class. There is no need to explicitly define the class of the created objects as FactoryBot deduces it directly from the name of the used fixture, `user`.

You can ask the defined factories to create objects in the following way:


```ruby
user = FactoryBot.create(:user)
```

Calling the factoryBot method _create_ will create an object in the testing environment database automatically.

Modify your tests now to use FactoryBot for creating user objects.

```ruby
describe "with a proper password" do
  let(:user) { FactoryBot.create(:user) } # tämä rivi muuttui
  let(:test_brewery) { Brewery.new name: "test", year: 2000 }
  let(:test_beer) { Beer.create name: "testbeer", style: "teststyle", brewery: test_brewery }

  it "is saved" do
    expect(user).to be_valid
    expect(User.count).to eq(1)
  end

  it "and with two ratings, has the correct average rating" do
    rating = Rating.new score: 10, beer: test_beer
    rating2 = Rating.new score: 20, beer: test_beer

    user.ratings << rating
    user.ratings << rating2

    expect(user.ratings.count).to eq(2)
    expect(user.average_rating).to eq(15.0)
  end
end
```

The change is yet quite minimal. Let's expand the fixtures so that we can use them to create also the rating objects used in the tests. Change file spec/factories.rb:

```ruby
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :user do
    username { "Pekka" }
    password { "Foobar1" }
    password_confirmation { "Foobar1" }
  end

  factory :brewery do
    name { "anonymous" }
    year { 1900 }
  end

  factory :beer do
    name { "anonymous" }
    style { "Lager" }
    brewery # the brewery associated with beer is created with brewery factory
  end

  factory :rating do
    score { 10 }
    beer # The beer associated with rating is created with beer factory
    user # The user associated with rating is created with user factory
  end
end
```

On top of the factory creating ratings, fixtures for creating breweries and beers are also now defined in the file.

The factory <code>FactoryBot.create(:brewery)</code> creates a brewery whose name is 'anonymous' and is founded in 1900.

The factory <code>FactoryBot.create(:beer)</code> creates a beer whose style is 'Lager' and name 'anonymous' and a brewery is created for it. Accordingly, the factory <code>FactoryBot.create(:rating)</code> creates a rating which is associated with the beer and user created by the factory. Additionally the value of the rating, field _score_, is set to 10.

The test can be edited to following:

```ruby
describe "with a proper password" do
  let(:user) { FactoryBot.create(:user) }

  it "is saved" do
    expect(user).to be_valid
    expect(User.count).to eq(1)
  end

  it "and with two ratings, has the correct average rating" do
    FactoryBot.create(:rating, score: 10, user: user)
    FactoryBot.create(:rating, score: 20, user: user)

    expect(user.ratings.count).to eq(2)
    expect(user.average_rating).to eq(15.0)
  end
end
```

The test creates two ratings, other's scrore is 10 and the other's 20, that are are associated with the user created with the help of a factory in the _let_ command.

```ruby
FactoryBot.create(:rating, score: 10, user: user)
FactoryBot.create(:rating, score: 20, user: user)
```


So you can ask the same factory to create various objects:

```ruby
FactoryBot.create(:brewery)
FactoryBot.create(:brewery)
FactoryBot.create(:brewery)
```

would create three _different_ brewery objects that would all have identical values.

You can edit the values of factory-created objects with parameters. E.g.:
```ruby
FactoryBot.create(:brewery)
FactoryBot.create(:brewery, name: 'crapbrew')
FactoryBot.create(:brewery, name: 'homebrew', year: 2011)
```

this would create three breweries of which one would get the default name _anonymous_ and foundation year _1900_. The second brewery would get the default foundation year but the name _crapbrew_. The third would get both its name and year from the given parameters. 

Also the user factory could be called twice:

```ruby
FactoryBot.create(:user)
FactoryBot.create(:user)
```

This would however raise an exception as <code>User</code> object validations expects that usernames are unique but the the factory by default always creates users with the username "Pekka".

The follwing would however be okay; creating two users with different usernames, the default _Pekka_ and additionally _Vilma_

```ruby
FactoryBot.create(:user)
FactoryBot.create(:user, username: 'Vilma')
```

## Users favourite beers, breweries, and styles


Create methods for user in a test driven style (or behaviour driven, as rspec creators would say). The methods will help you find out users' favourite beers, breweries, and styles based on users ratings.

Orthodox TDD requires that you do not code anything before it is required by a minimal test. Create a test first requiring that <code>User</code> objects have the method <code>favorite_beer</code>.


```ruby
it "has method for determining the favorite_beer" do
  user = FactoryBot.create(:user)
  expect(user).to respond_to(:favorite_beer)
end
```

The test will fail, so create the method body in the class User:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # ...

  def favorite_beer
  end
end
```

The test succeeds. Next add a test to check that without ratings, users will not have a favourite beer, so the method should return nil:

```ruby
it "without ratings does not have a favorite beer" do
  user = FactoryBot.create(:user)
  expect(user.favorite_beer).to eq(nil)
end
```

The test will pass because Ruby's methods return nil by default.

Refactor by adding a personal <code>describe</code> chunk to the two tests you have just written.

```ruby
describe "favorite beer" do
  let(:user){ FactoryBot.create(:user) }

  it "has method for determining one" do
    expect(user).to respond_to(:favorite_beer)
  end

  it "without ratings does not have one" do
    expect(user.favorite_beer).to eq(nil)
  end
end
```

Add a test then to check the method is able to return the rated beer, if there is only one rating.

```ruby
it "is the only rated if only one rating" do
  beer = FactoryBot.create(:beer)
  rating = FactoryBot.create(:rating, score: 20, beer: beer, user: user)

  # continues...
end
```

First a beer is created, the a rating. The <code>create</code> method of rating is given the score, beer object and user object (both created with Factorybot) as parameters. These are to be associated with the rating.

The created rating is connected to the user and is that user's only rating. In the end, the test expects that the beer associated with the rating is the user's favorite beer:

```ruby
it "is the only rated if only one rating" do
  beer = FactoryBot.create(:beer)
  rating = FactoryBot.create(:rating, score: 20, beer: beer, user: user)

  expect(user.favorite_beer).to eq(beer)
end
```

Your test will not succeed, because your method does not do anything so far, and its return value is always <code>nil</code>.

Use [in the spirit of TDD](https://stanislaw.github.io/2016/01/25/notes-on-test-driven-development-by-example-by-kent-beck.html) a "fake solution", without trying to make the final working version yet:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # ...

  def favorite_beer
    return nil if ratings.empty?   # returns nil if there are no ratings

    ratings.first.beer             # returns the beer which belongs to the first rating
  end
end
```

Make another test which will force you to make a real implementation [(see triangulation)](https://stanislaw.github.io/2016/01/25/notes-on-test-driven-development-by-example-by-kent-beck.html):

```ruby
it "is the one with highest rating if several rated" do
  beer1 = FactoryBot.create(:beer)
  beer2 = FactoryBot.create(:beer)
  beer3 = FactoryBot.create(:beer)
  rating1 = FactoryBot.create(:rating, score: 20, beer: beer1, user: user)
  rating2 = FactoryBot.create(:rating, score: 25, beer: beer2, user: user)
  rating3 = FactoryBot.create(:rating, score: 9, beer: beer3, user: user)

  expect(user.favorite_beer).to eq(beer2)
end
```

This creates three beers first and then ratings which belong to the beers as well as to the user object. 

The test will not succeed naturally, because the implementation of the method <code>favorite_beer</code> was left incomplete earlier.

Modify the method implementation to look like below:

```ruby
def favorite_beer
  return nil if ratings.empty?

  ratings.sort_by{ |r| r.score }.last.beer
end
```

So first the ratings are sorted by score, the last rating – the one with the highest score – is taken, and its beer is returned.

Because sorting was directly based on the rating attribute <code>score</code>, the last line of the method could have been written in a more compact form

```ruby
ratings.sort_by(&:score).last.beer
```

How does the method work, actually? Execute the operation from the console:

```ruby
> u = User.first
> u.ratings.sort_by(&:score).last.beer
  Rating Load (1.4ms)  SELECT "ratings".* FROM "ratings" WHERE "ratings"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 1]]
  Beer Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  "beers".* FROM "beers" WHERE "beers"."id" = ? LIMIT ?  [["id", 1], ["LIMIT", 1]]
```

It produces 2 SQL enquiries, where the first

```ruby
SELECT "ratings".* FROM "ratings" WHERE "ratings"."user_id" = ?  [["user_id", 1]]
```

retrieves all the user ratings from the database. The ratings are sorted in the main memory. If the amount of ratings belonging to the user is extremely vast, you had better optimize the operation so that it is executed at database level.

If you look at the documentation (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#ordering and http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#limit-and-offset) you will reach the following conclusion:

```ruby
def favorite_beer
  return nil if ratings.empty?
  ratings.order(score: :desc).limit(1).first.beer
end
```

You can check the SQL enquiry which resulted from the operation by hand from the console (notice the method <code>to_sql</code>):

```ruby
> u.ratings.order(score: :desc).limit(1).to_sql
=> "SELECT  \"ratings\".* FROM \"ratings\"  WHERE \"ratings\".\"user_id\" = ?  ORDER BY \"ratings\".\"score\" DESC LIMIT 1"
```


You should be patient when it comes to optimizing the execution capability and avoid optimizing each operation in the developing phase, if not necessary. 

## Auxiliary methods for tests

You must have noticed that the code to build the beers needed in tests is annoying. You could configure beers with ratings in FactoryBot. We decide to create however an auxiliary method <code>create_beer_with_rating</code> in the test file:

```ruby
def create_beer_with_rating(object, score)
  beer = FactoryBot.create(:beer)
  FactoryBot.create(:rating, beer: beer, score: score, user: object[:user] )
  beer
end
```

Making use of the auxiliary method will help you to polish your test

```ruby
it "is the one with highest rating if several rated" do
  create_beer_with_rating({ user: user }, 10 )
  create_beer_with_rating({ user: user }, 7 )
  best = create_beer_with_rating({ user: user }, 25 )

  expect(user.favorite_beer).to eq(best)
end
```

Passing the user who did the rating to the auxiliary methods is done in a somewhat peculiar way: as Ruby hash value. We could have defined that the user is passed as a normal parameter, similarly to the rating score:

```ruby
def create_beer_with_rating(user, score)
  beer = FactoryBot.create(:beer)
  FactoryBot.create(:rating, beer: beer, score: score, user: user )
  beer
end
```
However the previous method is more flexible in this case. It makes expanding the <code>create_beer_with_rating</code> method (needed in exercises 3 and 4) without breaking any test code possible.

Auxiliary method can (and should) be defined in rspec files. If the auxiliary method is needed in only in one test file, it can be place at the end of the file, for instance.

Improve again what you did before by defining another method <code>create_beers_with_ratings</code>, which allows to create various rated beers. The method receives as parameter a variable-length list which behaves like a table (see http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_methods.html, section "Variable-Length Argument Lists"):

```ruby
def create_beers_with_many_ratings(object, *scores)
  scores.each do |score|
    create_beer_with_rating(object, score)
  end
end
```

If you call the method like

```ruby
create_beers_with_many_ratings( {user: user}, 10, 15, 9)
```

the parameter <code>scores</code> will have a collection as value, containing the numbers 10, 15, and 9. The method creates three beers (with the help of the method <code>create_beer_with_rating</code>). They are given a user as parameter, the user has a rating, and the ratings will be given a score based on the numbers of the <code>scores</code> parameter.

Again, below you find the whole code to test the favourite beer:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe User, type: :model do

  # ..

  describe "favorite beer" do
    let(:user){ FactoryBot.create(:user) }

    it "has method for determining the favorite beer" do
      expect(user).to respond_to(:favorite_beer)
    end

    it "without ratings does not have a favorite beer" do
      expect(user.favorite_beer).to eq(nil)
    end

    it "is the only rated if only one rating" do
      beer = FactoryBot.create(:beer)
      rating = FactoryBot.create(:rating, score: 20, beer: beer, user: user)

      expect(user.favorite_beer).to eq(beer)
    end

    it "is the one with highest rating if several rated" do
      create_beers_with_many_ratings({user: user}, 10, 20, 15, 7, 9)
      best = create_beer_with_rating({ user: user }, 25 )

      expect(user.favorite_beer).to eq(best)
    end
  end
end # describe User

def create_beer_with_rating(object, score)
  beer = FactoryBot.create(:beer)
  FactoryBot.create(:rating, beer: beer, score: score, user: object[:user] )
  beer
end

def create_beers_with_many_ratings(object, *scores)
  scores.each do |score|
    create_beer_with_rating(object, score)
  end
end
```

### FactoryBot troubleshooting

Here we have gathered some problem cases encountered in previous years

####  Accidentally created object factory

It is good to point out that if you define the FactoryBot gem not only in the test environment but also in the development environment, like

```ruby
group :development, :test do
   gem 'factory_bot_rails'
    # ...
end
```

if you create new resources with Rails generator, fo instance:

    rails g scaffold bar name:string

a default factory will also be created:

```ruby
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :bar do
    name "MyString"
  end

  # ...
end
```


This may put you into strange situations (if you define a factory with the same name yourself, the default one will be used instead!), so you'd better define the gem only in the test environment following the instructions of the section https://github.com/mluukkai/webdevelopment-rails/blob/main/week4.md#test-environments-or-fixtures.

#### Objects left in test database

Normally, rspec resets the database after each test execution. This is because rspec executes each test in a transaction by default which is rollbacked or canceled after the test execution. Tests are not saved in the dataabase, then.

Occasionally objects can go to the database permanently during testing, however.

Suppose that you are testing the class <code>Beer</code:


```ruby
describe "when one beer exists" do
  beer = FactoryBot.create(:beer)

  it "is valid" do
    expect(beer).to be_valid
  end

  it "has the default style" do
    expect(beer.style).to eq("Lager")
  end
end
```

the <code>Beer</code> object created by the test would go to your test database for good, because the command <ode>FactoryBot.create(:beer)</code>  is located outside the tests, and it is not executed it during canceling transactions!

Therefore, you will not want to place object creation code outside the tests (except for the methods which are called by the tests). Objects should be created in the test contex, either inside the method <code>it</code>:

```ruby
describe "when one beer exists" do
  it "is valid" do
    beer = FactoryBot.create(:beer)
    expect(beer).to be_valid
  end

  it "has the default style" do
    beer = FactoryBot.create(:beer)
    expect(beer.style).to eq("Lager")
  end
end
```

inside the command <code>let</code> or <code>let!</code>:

```ruby
describe "when one beer exists" do
  let(:beer){FactoryBot.create(:beer)}

  it "is valid" do
    expect(beer).to be_valid
  end

  it "has the default style" do
    expect(beer.style).to eq("Lager")
  end
end
```

or in the <code>before</code> chunk which you familiarize yourself with later on.

You can delete the beers which eventually ended up in the test database by starting the console in the test environment with the command <code>rails c -e test</code>.

#### Validation

The uniqueness restrictions which are defined in the validation can produce something unespected sometimes. The User username has been defined as unique, so the test

```ruby
describe "the application" do
  it "does something with two users" do
    user1 = FactoryBot.create(:user)
    user2 = FactoryBot.create(:user)

  # ...
  end
end
```

would cause the error message

```
1) User the application does something with two users
    Failure/Error: user2 = FactoryBot.create(:user)

    ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid:
      Validation failed: Username has already been taken
    # ./spec/models/user_spec.rb:77:in `block (3 levels) in <main>'
```

because FactoryBot tries to create two user objects now through the definition

```ruby
factory :user do
  username { "Pekka" }
  password { "Foobar1" }
  password_confirmation { "Foobar1" }
end
```

so that 'Pekka' will be the username of both. You could solve the problem by giving another name to either of the objects which are being created:

```ruby
describe "the application" do
  it "does something with two users" do
    user1 = FactoryBot.create(:user)
    user2 = FactoryBot.create(:user, username: "Vilma")

  # ...
  end
end
```

Another option would be defining the usernames used by FactoryBot with the help of sequences, see
https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/factory_bot/file/GETTING_STARTED.md#sequences

The factory would change to:
```ruby
FactoryBot.define do
  sequence :username do |n|
    "Pekka#{n}"
  end

  factory :user do
    username { generate :username }
    password { "Foobar1" }
    password_confirmation { "Foobar1" }
  end

  # ...
end
```

Now the names of the users created by sequential <code>FactoryBot.create(:user)</code> factory calls would be _Pekka1_, _Pekka2_, _Pekka3_ ...

**However, don't change** your factory to this form as it will break a part of this week's tests!

## Tests and debugger

Hopefully you've made a routine of using [debugger](https://github.com/mluukkai/webdevelopment-rails/blob/main/week2.md#debugger). Because tests are also normal Ruby code,  _binding.pry_  can also be used in both the test code and the code to be tested. The database status of the testing environment can be surprising sometimes, as you have seen in the examples above. In case of problems you should definitely stop your test code with the debugger and check whether the state of the ojects to test corresponds to what you expected.

## Executing individual tests
With rspec you can also execute individual tests or _describe_ blocks. Eg. the following would execute only the test starting from line 108 of file user_spec.rb:

```ruby
rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb:108
```

If/when you ran into problems:
- don't run all tests, limit execution to only problematic tests
- use debugger

> ## Exercise 3
>
> ### This and the following exercise might be challenging. It is not essential that you make these two exercises if you want to continue with the material of the rest of the week, so do not get stuck here. You can also do them after you are done with the others.
>
> Make the method <code>favorite_style</code> for the <code>User</code> object in a TDD style. The method should return the style whose beers have received the highest avarage rating from the user.
>
>Add information about the user's favourite style to their page.
>
> Do not do everything with one method (unless you solve the problem at database level with ActiveRecord or another elegantly compact solution), instead, define the suitable auxiliary methods! If you notice that you method is more than 6 lines long, you are doing either too much or something too complicated, so refactor your code. Ruby's collections have various auxiliary methods which might be useful for the exercise, see http://http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Enumerable.html

> ## Exercise 4
>
> Make now the method <code>favorite_brewery</code> for the <code>User</code> object in a TDD style. The method should return the brewery whose beers have received the highest avarage rating from the user.
>
>Add information about the user favourite brewery to their page.
>
> The methods <code>favorite_brewery</code> and <code>favorite_style</code> are similar, and most likely more or less copy-paste. On week 5 we will have an example of cleaning up code.

## Capybara

We will move to program-level testing now. You are going to write automatic tests which use the application through the browser as normal users do. The de-facto solution for browser level testing with applications on Rails is Capybara https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara. The tests themselves are written in Rspec still, Capybara provides you with the browser simulation for the Rspec tests.

Capybara is by default configured into the application. Add the helper library [launchy](https://github.com/copiousfreetime/launchy) to the Gemfile (in test scope), so your test scope should look like what is written below:


```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 6.0.0.rc1'
  gem 'factory_bot_rails'
  gem "capybara"
  gem "selenium-webdriver"
  gem "webdrivers"
  gem 'launchy'
end
```

In order to set up the gems, you will have to execute the command <code>bundle install</code>. 

You are ready now for your first browser-level test.

It is common to place the browser-level tests in the folder _spec/features_. Unit tests are usually organised so that the tests for each class are put in their own file. It is not always so clear how user-level tests which are executed through the browser should be organised. One option is using a file for each controller, another option is dividing the tests in different files according to the different functionalities of the system.

Get started by defining the tests for your breweries funcionality, and create the file spec/features/breweries_page_spec.rb:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

describe "Breweries page" do
  it "should not have any before been created" do
    visit breweries_path
    expect(page).to have_content 'Listing breweries'
    expect(page).to have_content 'Number of breweries: 0'
  end
end
```

The test will start navigating to the brewery list using the method <code>visit</code>. As you will see, Rails path helpers are used by Rspec tests too. After doing this, it checks whether the rendered page contains the text 'Listing breweries' and whether it tells the brewery number is 0 – the text 'Number of breweries: 0'. Capybara sets the page where the test currently is into the <code>page</code> variable.

While testing, there will be a (great) amount of situations where it is useful seeing the HTML source code of the page which corresponds to the <code>page</code> variable. This is possible adding the command <code>puts page.html</code> to the test.

Another option is providing the test with the command <code>save_and_open_page</code>, which saves and opens the page in a default browser. In Linux, you will have to define the browser using the environment variable <code>BROWSER</code>. For instance, you can define Chrome in the department computers with the command:

    export BROWSER='/usr/bin/chromium-browser'

The definition will be enforced only in the shell where you make it. If you want to make it persistant, add it in the file ~/.bashrc

For both <code>puts page.html</code> and <code>save_and_open_page</code> command to work they need to be placed before the last line of test. In this test both could be placed even on the first line.

Now execute the test as usual with <code>rspec spec</code>. If you want to execute only this newest test, remember that you can limit what tests are to be run by eg.:

    rspec spec/features/breweries_page_spec.rb

** The test most likely fails.** Figure out why and fix either the test or the text on the page. Using the command <code>save_and_open_page</code> is highly recommended!

Add a test for a situation where there are three breweries in the database:

```ruby
it "lists the existing breweries and their total number" do
  breweries = ["Koff", "Karjala", "Schlenkerla"]
  breweries.each do |brewery_name|
    FactoryBot.create(:brewery, name: brewery_name)
  end

  visit breweries_path

  expect(page).to have_content "Number of breweries: #{breweries.count}"

  breweries.each do |brewery_name|
    expect(page).to have_content brewery_name
  end
end
```

Also add a test to make sure that you can access a brewery page by clicking a link in the page with breweries. Make use of Capybara <code>click_link</code> method, which helps to click on a page links.

```ruby
it "allows user to navigate to page of a Brewery" do
  breweries = ["Koff", "Karjala", "Schlenkerla"]
  year = 1896
  breweries.each do |brewery_name|
    FactoryBot.create(:brewery, name: brewery_name, year: year += 1)
  end

  visit breweries_path

  click_link "Koff"

  expect(page).to have_content "Koff"
  expect(page).to have_content "Established at 1897"
end
```

The test wil go through if the text on the page matches the tests. In case of problems you should add the command <code>save_and_open_page</code> in the test and check visually the contents of the page opened by the test.

In the two last tests, the beginning is the same – you create three breweries first and then navigate to the breweries page.

You find below the refactored result, where the tests containing the same initiations are moved to their own describe chunk, where the <code>before :each</code> chunk has been defined to initiate them.

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

describe "Breweries page" do
  it "should not have any before been created" do
    visit breweries_path
    expect(page).to have_content 'Listing breweries'
    expect(page).to have_content 'Number of breweries: 0'

  end

  describe "when breweries exists" do
    before :each do
      # So that the variable is visible inside the it block, the name must start with @ 
      @breweries = ["Koff", "Karjala", "Schlenkerla"]
      year = 1896
      @breweries.each do |brewery_name|
        FactoryBot.create(:brewery, name: brewery_name, year: year += 1)
      end

      visit breweries_path
    end

    it "lists the breweries and their total number" do
      expect(page).to have_content "Number of breweries: #{@breweries.count}"
      @breweries.each do |brewery_name|
        expect(page).to have_content brewery_name
      end
    end

    it "allows user to navigate to page of a Brewery" do
      click_link "Koff"

      expect(page).to have_content "Koff"
      expect(page).to have_content "Established at 1897"
    end

  end
end
```

Notice that the <code>before :each</code> inside the describe chunk is executed once before each test defined under describe and **each test starts in a situation where the database is empty**.

Also note that if you must refer to variables created inside the <code>before :each</code> block from inside a test (ie. _it_ block) the variable names must start with the @ character.

## Testing user functionality

Move to user functionality, create the file _spec/features/users_page_spec.rb_ for this. Get started with a test to check whether users can log in the system:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

describe "User" do
  before :each do
    FactoryBot.create :user
  end

  describe "who has signed up" do
    it "can signin with right credentials" do
      visit signin_path
      fill_in('username', with: 'Pekka')
      fill_in('password', with: 'Foobar1')
      click_button('Log in')

      expect(page).to have_content 'Welcome back!'
      expect(page).to have_content 'Pekka'
    end
  end
end
```


The test demonstrate an interaction with the form, the command <code>fill_in</code> looks for a text field based on the _id_ field and inputs the parameter value.  As you might have guessed, <code>click_button</code> searches for a button in the page and clicks on it.

Notice the <code>before :each</code> chunk in the test, which uses FactoryBot to create a User object before each test. Signing up would not work without the object, because the database is reset before each test execution.

More examples about various topics such as how to look for page elements using forms can be found in Capybara documentation, in the section The DSL, see https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#the-dsl.

Implement a couple of tests more for user. The input of a wrong password should redirect back to the sign-in page:

```ruby
  describe "who has signed up" do
    # ...

    it "is redirected back to signin form if wrong credentials given" do
      visit signin_path
      fill_in('username', with: 'Pekka')
      fill_in('password', with: 'wrong')
      click_button('Log in')

      expect(current_path).to eq(signin_path)
      expect(page).to have_content 'Username and/or password mismatch'
    end
  end
```

The tests uses the method <code>current_path</code> which returns the path where the test execution has led to when the method is called. The method helps making sure the user is redirected back to the sign-in page if signing in failed.

It is not always so clear to what extent you should test your application business logic through browser-level tests. At least testing the logic to find out the user object favourite beer, brewery, and beer style with unit tests is sensible.

User-level tests can be used for instance to make sure pages show the same situation that there is in the database. So for instance, in your brewery page test you generated three breweries and tested that they are all rendered in the brewery list.

It makes sense to test that you can add and remove things on the pages, too. The test below for instance will make sure when a new user registers, the number of users in the system increases by one:

```ruby
it "when signed up with good credentials, is added to the system" do
  visit signup_path
  fill_in('user_username', with: 'Brian')
  fill_in('user_password', with: 'Secret55')
  fill_in('user_password_confirmation', with: 'Secret55')

  expect{
    click_button('Create User')
  }.to change{User.count}.by(1)
end
```

Notice that the form fields were defined in the <code>fill_in</code> methods slightly differently than in the sign-in form. The fields' IDs can and should always be checked by looking at the page source code choosing _view page source_ in browser.

The test expects that clicking the _Create user_ button will cause the number of saved users in the database to increase by one. The syntax is brilliant, but it will take some time before Rspec's strongly expressive language will start to feel familiar.

You will have to take into consideration a small detail, that is, the method <code>expect</code> can be given parameters in two ways.
If the method has to test a value, the value is given between brackets, like <code>expect(current_path).to eq(signin_path)</code>. Instead, if it tests the impact of an operation (like the one above, <code>click_button('Create User')</code>) on the value of an application object (<code>User.count</code>), the operation to execute is given to <code>expect</code> in a code chunk.

Read more about this in Rspec documentation https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers

So the last test checked whether the operation executed at browser level created an object in the database. Should you make a separate test to see whether a user name can sign in the system? Maybe. After all, the previous test did not questioned whether the user object was saved in the database correctly.

The scope for testing is so wide, however, that a complete analysis is impossible and tests should be written in first place for things which might break.

Create a new test for beer rating. Create the file _spec/features/ratings_page_spec.rb_ for the test.

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

describe "Rating" do
  let!(:brewery) { FactoryBot.create :brewery, name: "Koff" }
  let!(:beer1) { FactoryBot.create :beer, name: "iso 3", brewery:brewery }
  let!(:beer2) { FactoryBot.create :beer, name: "Karhu", brewery:brewery }
  let!(:user) { FactoryBot.create :user }

  before :each do
    visit signin_path
    fill_in('username', with: 'Pekka')
    fill_in('password', with: 'Foobar1')
    click_button('Log in')
  end

  it "when given, is registered to the beer and user who is signed in" do
    visit new_rating_path
    select('iso 3', from: 'rating[beer_id]')
    fill_in('rating[score]', with: '15')

    expect{
      click_button "Create Rating"
    }.to change{Rating.count}.from(0).to(1)

    expect(user.ratings.count).to eq(1)
    expect(beer1.ratings.count).to eq(1)
    expect(beer1.average_rating).to eq(15.0)
  end
end
```

The test builds its brewery, two beers and a user with the method <code>let!</code> instead of <code>let</code> which we used earlier. In fact, the version without exclamative mark does not execute the operation immediately, but only once the code refers to the object explicitely. The object <code>beer1</code> is mentioned only at the end of the code, so if you had created it with the method <code>let</code>, you would have run into a problem creating the rating, because its beer would have not existed in the database yet, and the corresponding select element would not have been found.


The code contained in the <code>before</code> chunk of the test helps users to sign in the system. Most probably, the same code chunk will be useful in various different test files. You had better extract the test code needed in various different places and make a [module](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-core/docs/helper-methods/define-helper-methods-in-a-module), which can be included in all test files which need it. Create a module <code>Helpers</code> in a file named _helpers.rb_ in the _specs_ directory and put the sign-in code there:

```ruby
module Helpers

  def sign_in(credentials)
    visit signin_path
    fill_in('username', with:credentials[:username])
    fill_in('password', with:credentials[:password])
    click_button('Log in')
  end
end
```

So the method <code>sign_in</code> takes a hash parameter with the user name and password.

In the file _rails_helper.rb_, add this line immediately after the other require commands:

    require 'helpers'

Start to use the module method in your tests with the <code>include Helpers</code> command:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

include Helpers

describe "Rating" do
  let!(:brewery) { FactoryBot.create :brewery, name: "Koff" }
  let!(:beer1) { FactoryBot.create :beer, name: "iso 3", brewery:brewery }
  let!(:beer2) { FactoryBot.create :beer, name: "Karhu", brewery:brewery }
  let!(:user) { FactoryBot.create :user }

  before :each do
    sign_in(username: "Pekka", password: "Foobar1")
  end
```

and

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'

include Helpers

describe "User" do
  before :each do
    FactoryBot.create :user
  end

  describe "who has signed up" do
    it "can signin with right credentials" do
      sign_in(username: "Pekka", password: "Foobar1")

      expect(page).to have_content 'Welcome back!'
      expect(page).to have_content 'Pekka'
    end

    it "is redirected back to signin form if wrong credentials given" do
      sign_in(username: "Pekka", password: "wrong")

      expect(current_path).to eq(signin_path)
      expect(page).to have_content 'Username and/or password mismatch'
    end
  end

  it "when signed up with good credentials, is added to the system" do
    visit signup_path
    fill_in('user_username', with: 'Brian')
    fill_in('user_password', with: 'Secret55')
    fill_in('user_password_confirmation', with: 'Secret55')

    expect{
      click_button('Create User')
    }.to change{User.count}.by(1)
  end
end
```

Letting an auxiliary method be in charge of sign-in implementation will also improve the test clarity, and if the sign-up page functionality changes later on, maintaining the tests will be easy, because changes will be required only in one place.

Moving the previously defined methods <code>create\_beer\_with\_rating</code> and <code>create\_beers\_with\_many\_ratings</code> (in _user_spec.rb_) to the Helpers module as well might be smart, especially if we'll be needing these functionalities in other places as well.

## Test coverage

The test line coverage measures the percentage of the program code lines that is executed when tests are executed. It is easy to measure the test coverage on Rails with the gem _simplecov_, see https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov

Get started with the gem by adding the following line to the Gemfile test scope

    gem 'simplecov', require: false

**Attention** instead of a normal <code>bundle install</code> command you might have to execute the command <code>bundle update</code> at this point, in order to set up all the gem versions that are mutually fit.

In order to start using simplecov, you should add the following code **in the first two lines** of the file rails_helper.rb:

```ruby
require 'simplecov'
SimpleCov.start('rails')
```

The run the tests (see the note above if you have problems here)

```ruby
$ rspec spec
..................................

Finished in 1.25 seconds (files took 1.95 seconds to load)
34 examples, 0 failures

Coverage report generated for RSpec to /Users/mluukkai/opetus/ratebeer/coverage. 161 / 333 LOC (48.35%) covered.
```

The tests line coverage is 48.35 percent. You find a more detailed report opening the file coverage/index.html with your browser. As it is shown by the picture, there are still large parts of the program which are tested poorly, especially as far as the controllers are concerned:

![picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2022/main/images/ratebeer-w4-1.png)


Wide-ranging tests does not mean that you are testing smart things, of course. Because it is easy to measure, it is better than nothing and it shows the most evident issues, at least.

> ## Exercise 10
>
> Start to use Simplecov in your code. Examine the report (by clicking yellow and red colored classes) to see which lines of your code are not tested at all.


## Continuous integration

With the term [continuous integration](http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html) we mean the custom where the program developers integrate their code changes into a common development branch as often as possible. The idea is to make sure the program's development version works all the time, thus eliminating the difficult, separate integration stage. The continuous integration requires a wide-ranging group of automatic tests to work. It is common when it comes to continuous integration to use a centralized server, which pays attention to the repository where the development version is located. When developers integrate their code in the developing version, the integration server sees the change, builds the code, and runs the tests. If the tests fail, the integration server reports this in a way or in another to whom it may concern.

GitHub offers [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for developers' use. GitHub Actions has  gained much ground among other CI services. Notable motivations for using GitHub Actions is that it is directly integrated to GitHub and the Actions marketplace which contains more actions that can be implemented to your CI. More on these later.

Projects stored in GitHub are easy to set under GitHub Actions' watch.

## Continuous delivery

Continuous delivery is a practice one more step beyond the continuous integration (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery). A part of it is continuous deployment, that is the idea to deploy the code to a production-like environment or even straight to production in the best case, every time that the code is integrated. 

Especially for Web application, continuous deployment can be an operation which does not require too much effort.

> ## Exercise 13
> ### Doing this exercise is not vital for continuing the week. You can also do it after the other exercises.
>
> Implement a continuous deployment of your application to Heroku or Fly.io.
>
> Intructions for Fly.io: https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/continuous-deployment-with-github-actions/
>
> Instruction for Heroku: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration
>
> **Attention**: If using Heroku, remember to choose "Wait for CI to pass before deploy".
>
> You can check if your CI/CD pipeline works by making some change to your application, committing the changes to GitHub and seeing whether that change happens also in your application in Heroku/Fly.io. In Heroku, from tab _Latest activity_ you can a find logs on what happens in your pipeline.
## Code quality metrics

In addition to the test coverage, you should also pay attention to the code quality. Codeclimate (https://codeclimate.com) is a SaaS which allows you to generate various quality metrics for your Rails code.

The amount of services to help the application developer's life increases from day to day. Instead of or in addition to Simplecov, you can delegate the test coverage report to Coveralls https://coveralls.io/ -nimiselle pilvipalvelulle. This time we will skip that.

## Functions for signed-in users

Leave tests for a moment and go back to a couple of the previous themes. In week 2, you defined your application with http basic authentication so that users could delete breweries only with the admin password. [In week 3](https://github.com/mluukkai/webdevelopment-rails/blob/main/week3.md#deleting-only-ones-own-ratings) you defined your application functionality so that deleting ratings was not possible for others than the user who created that rating. Instead, things like creating, removing, and editing beer clubs and beers are possible even without signing in, so far.

Put http basic authentication aside, and change your application so that beers, breweries, and beer groups can be created, edited and deleted only by signed-in users.

Get started by removing the http basic authentication. So remove the following line from the brewery controller

    before_action :authenticate, only: [:destroy]

as well as the method <code>authenticate</code>. Anyone can again remove breweries, now.

Start to add a protection.

It is easy to remove beers, beer clubs, and breweries editing and creation links from the sight if users are not signed in the system.

For instance, you can remove the beers creation link for non-signed-in users from the end of the page of the view views/beers/index.html.erb:

```erb
<% if not current_user.nil? %>
  <%= link_to "New beer", new_beer_path %>
<% end %>
```

So the creation link is shown only if the <code>current_user</code> is not <code>nil</code>. And you can make use of the more compact form of if:

```erb
<%= link_to('New Beer', new_beer_path) if not current_user.nil? %>
```

Now, the <code>link_to</code> method will be executed – that is, the link code will be rendered – only if the if condition is true. 'If not' conditions don't make a too good Ruby code, a better option would be using <code>unless</code>:

```erb
<%= link_to('New Beer', new_beer_path) unless current_user.nil? %>
```

So the link is rendered __unless__ the <code>current_user</code> is <code>nil</code>.

Actually, <code>unless</code> would be useless now, because <code>nil</code> is interpreted as false in Ruby, so the neatest form for the command would be

```erb
<%= link_to('New Beer', new_beer_path) if current_user %>
```

You will remove the adding, removing, and editing links soon, before doing it however, have a look at the protection at controller level. In fact, even though you removed all links to restriced actions, nothing prevents users from making a straight HTTP request to the application, and in this way doing an action which should be restricted to signed-in users.

So you will still have to make sure at controller level that if users try for some reason to do a forbidden action straight with HTTP, the action will not be executed.

We decide to direct users to the signed-in page if they try to do restricted actions.

Define the following method for the class <code>ApplicationController</code>:

```ruby
def ensure_that_signed_in
  redirect_to signin_path, notice: 'you should be signed in' if current_user.nil?
end
```

So if users call the medhod without being signed-in, they are redirected to the signed-in page. Because the method is located in the class <code>ApplicationController</code> and all the controllers inherit this class, the method will be available for all controllers.

Add the method as a "before" filter (see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#filters and https://github.com/mluukkai/webdevelopment-rails/blob/main/week2.md#a-simple-protection) for beer, brewery, and beer club controllers for all the methods except for index and show:


```ruby
class BeersController < ApplicationController
  before_action :ensure_that_signed_in, except: [:index, :show]

  #...
end
```

For instance, when a beer is being created Rails executes the filter <code>ensure_that_signed_in</code> before the method <code>create</code>, so the filter redirects to the sign-in page users who did not sign-in. If the user had signed in the system, the filter would not have done anything, and the new beer would have been created normally.

Try out that the changes work with your browser. So non-signed-in users are redirected to the sign-in page when they do any action which is restriced with the "before" filter, but signed-in users can access the page smoothly.

> ## Exercise 15
>
> Using "before" filters, prevent non-signed-in users from doing any action connected to breweries and beer clubs except listing them and showing the information of singular resources (so the methods <code>show</code> and <code>index</code>)
>
> When you have made sure that the functionality works fine, remove from the views all superfluous creating, removing, and editing links for non-signed-in users.

> ## Exercise 16
>
> The extensions done before exercise 15 have broken some of you tests. Fix the tests

## Polishing the application interface

If you want, you can polish the application views. For instance, you can remove the creating, deleting and editing links from non-signed-in users. These changes are not compulsory and are not excepted to have been done in the following weeks.

## Submitting the exercises

Commit all your changes and push the code to Github. Deploy to the newest version of Heroku or Fly.io, too.

Mark that the exercises you have done at https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/rails2022.

You will continue to develop your application from the point you arrived at the end of week 1. The material that follows comes with the assumption that you have done all the exercises of the previous week. In case you have not done all of them, you can take the sample answer to the previous week [from the course repository](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/tree/master/malliv/viikko1). If you already got most of the previous week exercises done, it might be easier if you complement your own answer with the help of the material.

If you start working this week on the base of last week sample answer, copy the folder from the course repository (assuming you have alrady cloned it) and make a new repository of the folder with the application.

**Attention:** some Mac users have found problems with the pg-gem which Heroku needs. Gems are not needed locally and we defined to set them only in the production environment. If you have problems, you can set gems by adding the following expression to <code>bundle install</code>:

    bundle install --without production

This setting will be remembered later on, so a simple `bundle install` will be enough if you want to set up new dependences.

## Application layout

You want to put a navigation bar in your page like modern Web sites, placing a link to the lists with beers and breweries at the top of _all_ pages.

You can generate a navigation bar with the help of the method <code>link_to</code> and path helpers by adding the following links to each page:

```erb
<%= link_to 'breweries', breweries_path %>
<%= link_to 'beers', beers_path %>
```

If you had sharp eyes you might have noticed last week already that view templates do not contain all the HTML code of the pages. For instance, the view template for one beer, /app/views/beers/show.html.erb, looks like below:

```erb
<p id="notice"><%= notice %></p>

<p>
  <strong>Name:</strong>
  <%= @beer.name %>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Style:</strong>
  <%= @beer.style %>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Brewery:</strong>
  <%= @beer.brewery_id %>
</p>

<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_beer_path(@beer) %> |
<%= link_to 'Back', beers_path %>
```

If you look at the HTML code of the page of one beer using the _view source code_ option, you will see, that the page has much more HTML code than it is defined in the template (a part of the head contents has been removed):

```erb

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Ratebeer</title>
  <link data-turbolinks-track="true" href="/assets/application.css?body=1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" />
  <script data-turbolinks-track="true" src="/assets/jquery.js?body=1"></script>
  <meta content="authenticity_token" name="csrf-param" />
<meta content="hZaC8o95xUbekA3PTsVZ+JmkVj9CCn5a4Kw8tF96WOU=" name="csrf-token" />
</head>
<body>

<p id="notice"></p>

<p>
  <strong>Name:</strong>
  Iso 3
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Style:</strong>
  Lager
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Brewery:</strong>
  1
</p>

<a href="/beers/1/edit">Edit</a> |
<a href="/beers">Back</a>


</body>
</html>
```

The page contains the type definition of the document, the head element which defines the style files and Javascript files to use, and the body element which defines the page contents (see more at http://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/HTML/Training).

The view template of the beer page contains only the HTML code which comes with the body element.

It's typical that all the pages of the application are the same except for the contents of the body element. In Rails, we can define the parts in common to all pages in the application _layout_, the file app/views/layouts/application.html.erb. The file contents will be the following by default:

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Ratebeer</title>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag    "application", media: "all", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag "application", "data-turbolinks-track" => true %>
  <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
</head>
<body>

<%= yield %>

</body>
</html>
```
The auxiliary methods inside the Head element define the style and javascript files which are used by the application. The auxiliary method <code>csrf_meta_tags</code> adds to the file the logic to eliminate CSRF attacs (see the [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9996665/rails-how-does-csrf-meta-tag-work) for more information). As you may have guessed, the <code>yield</code> command inside the body element helps to render the contents defined by the view template of each page.

We can display a navigation bar in all pages by modifying the body element of our application layout in the following way:

```erb
<body>
  <div class="navibar">
    <%= link_to 'breweries', breweries_path %>
    <%= link_to 'beers', beers_path %>
  </div>

  <%= yield %>

</body>
```

The navigation bar has been set up in the div element which contains the _navibar_ class. We can modify its layout with the help of our CSS files.

Add the following to the file app/assets/stylesheets/application.css:

```erb
.navibar {
    padding: 10px;
    background: #EFEFEF;
}
```

When you reload the page, you'll notice your application will almost look professional.

## routes.rb

The Routing component on Rails
(see http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing.html, http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html) is in charge of handling the HTTP requests of the application and of routing them to the appropriate method controller.

The file <code>config/routes.rb</code> contains the information of how to route the requests to the various URLs. At this point, the file contents look like this:

```ruby
Ratebeer::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :beers
  resources :breweries
end
```

Later on, we will get to know the rounts which are added by the method <code>resources</code>.

Let us get started by creating a default webpage containing a list of the breweries. This will happen by adding the following line to the routes file

    root 'breweries#index'

The address http://localhost:3000/ will now lead to a page with all breweries.

What we wrote above is but the more fashonable way to say:

    get '/', to: 'breweries#index'

this means that when an HTTP GET request arrives to the path '/', it routed and handled by the <code>index</code> method of the <code>BreweriesController</code> class.

If we read the documentation, we should pay attention that controllers methods are often called _actions_, on Rails. In any case, we have decided to use the name controller method in the course.

Similarly, you could also add the following line to routes.rb

    get 'kaikki_bisset', to: 'beers#index'

In such case, the GET requests to the URL http://localhost:3000/kaikki_bisset would lead to the page of all beers. Try that it works.

An interesting thing of the routes.rb file is that, even though it looks like a configuration file of pure text, all the contents are written in Ruby. The file lines are method calls. For instance the line

    get 'kaikki_bisset', to: 'beers#index'

calls the get method whose parameters are the string '/kaikki_bisset' and the hash <code>to: 'beers#index'</code>. There have been used various kinds of syntax for hash expressions. If we use the old syntax, the part of the hash which defines the routing would be written <code>:to => 'beers#index'</code>, and the line of routes.rb would be:

    get 'kaikki_bisset', :to => 'beers#index'

we could also use brackets in the method call, and define the hash using curly brackets. The following might look clumsy but it is correct to define the route:

    get( 'kaikki_bisset', { :to => 'beers#index' } )

The elastic syntax (together with other characteristic features of the language) allows for a form which aims at the fluency of natural languages while configuring and programming applications. The style is well known in English with the name _Internal DSL_, see http://martinfowler.com/bliki/InternalDslStyle.html.

## Rating beers

Let us add the possibility to rate beers, that is to say, to give them a grade from 0 to 50. We will not use the generator that we have discovered last week (<code>rails generate scaffold...</code>), but we are going to create one ourselves, instead.

We want that all the rating are available at the address http://localhost:3000/ratings. Let us try to see what happens in our browser when we try to reach the URL.

The result in the error expression <code>No route matches [GET] "/ratings"</code> which tells us that the HTTP GET request which was done to the address was not matched by any defined route.

Let us add the route by creating the following line in the routes file:

    get 'ratings', to: 'ratings#index'

In Rails conventions, this defines that the index method of the RaitingsController class will be in charge of the raitings of the page of all routes.

Attention: if you wrote <code>match 'ratings' => 'ratings#index'</code>, you would get almost the same result. As it is typical in Rails, there are different ways to define the same thing in routes.rb, too.

Ckeck out the page again in you browser. The error exception has changed to a new form, <code>uninitialized constant RatingsController</code>. This means that when the GET request arrives to the ratings address, the defined route tries to lead it so that it would be handled by the <code>index</code> method of the controller which is defined in the class <code>RatingsController</code>.

Let us define a controller in the file /app/controllers/ratings_controller.rb.

```ruby
class RatingsController < ApplicationController
  def index
  end
end
```

Pay attention to the name conventions and file location â€“ Rails looks for the controller in the folder /app/controllers. If you place the controller somewhere else, Rails will not find it.

Try out the page with the browser once more.

You will receive the following error exception

        Missing template ratings/index, application/index with {:locale=>[:en], :formats=>[:html], :handlers=>[:erb, :builder, :raw, :ruby, :jbuilder, :coffee]}. Searched in: * "/Users/mluukkai/kurssirepot/wadror/ratebeer/app/views"

Thi depends that Rails tries to render the default view template which corresponds to the controller method and that is located in the directory /app/views/ratings/index.html.erb. Such file is not found, however.

Let us create the file /app/views/ratings/index.html.erb with the following contents:

```erb
<h2>List of ratings</h2>

<p>To be completed...</p>
```

and now the page works!

Note again Rails convensions and the file location, which is defined carefully. Because it is a view template which is called by the ratings controller (which in turn is called exactly RatingsController), the view template is place in the directory /views/ratings.

Another reminder from [last week](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/blob/master/web/viikko1.md#kontrollerin-ja-viewien-yhteys): the <code>index</code> controll method renders the index view (which is located in the appropriate directory) at the end of the execution by default. The code

```ruby
class RatingsController < ApplicationController
  def index
  end
end
```

does the same thing as:

```ruby
class RatingsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    render :index    # renders the view template /app/views/ratings/index.html
  end
end
```

In any case, we do not explicitely call the render method so that the default file is rendered â€“ that is to say the template with the same name of the controller method.

## Creating the model by hand: done, almost...

One beer has many ratings, which means that the object model should be updated to look as follows:

![One beer has many ratings](http://yuml.me/4ef16c6a)

We need a database table and the corresponding model object.

It is good to use migrations __always__ when you want to make changes on Rails, for instance when adding a table. The migrations are files which have to be placed in the directory db/migrate, and where we note the Ruby operations which modify the database. We will better familiarize ourselves with migrations only later on. Now, we use Rails ready-made _model generator_ to create our model. The generator not only creates a model object but it also generates automatically the migration we need.

Ratings have an integer <code>score</code> and a foreign key, which links to the rated beer. According to Rails conventions, the foreign key name has to be <code>beer_id</code>.

You can create the model and the migration which generates the database by giving the following command in the command line:

    rails g model Rating score:integer beer_id:integer

and the database table by executing the following migration in the command line

    rake db:migrate

Differently than the _scaffold_ generator which we used last week, the model generator does not even create a controller or view templates.

**A reminder from last week:** the files generated by Rails generators (scaffold, model, ...) can be deleted with the command *destroy*:

    rails destroy model Rating

If you have already executed the migration and you notice that the code created by the generator has to be destroyed, it is **extremely important** that you first cancel the migration with the command

    rake db:rollback

In order to establish the connections at object level too (check [last week material](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/blob/master/web/viikko1.md#oluet-ja-yhden-suhde-moneen--yhteys), the classes have to be upadate in the following way

```ruby
class Beer < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :brewery
  has_many :ratings
end

class Rating < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :beer
end
```

Each beer has many ratings and a ratings belongs to one sole beer always.

Start the Rails console running the command <code>rails c</code> from the command line. Notice that if your console was open already, you can start to use the new code in the console by running <code>reload!</code>. Create a few ratings:

```ruby
2.0.0-p451 :001 > b = Beer.first
2.0.0-p451 :002 > b.ratings.create score:10
2.0.0-p451 :003 > b.ratings.create score:21
2.0.0-p451 :004 > b.ratings.create score:17
```

The ratings are added to the first beer which is found in the database. Notice the way it was created; you could have run the same thing with the more complex

```ruby
    b.ratings << Rating.create score:15
```

>## Exercise 1
>
>The console use routine is extremely important for Rails developers. Do the following things by hand:
>
>create a new brewery "BrewDog", the founding date is 2007<br/>
>add two beers to the brewery
>* Punk IPA (style IPA)
>* Nanny State (style lowalcohol)
>add a couple of ratings to both beers
>
>Go through last week [material](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/blob/master/web/viikko1.md) in case you need and check the parts about console use.
>
>return this exercise by adding the directory exercises in your application. The directory has to contain the file exercise1, with the copy-pasted console session

Our database contains ratings now, and we want to make sure they appear on a page with all ratings.

> ## Exercise 2
>
> Add all the ratings on a ratings page. You can use the brewery controller <code>index</code> method and the corresponding template as model. When you make the rating list, use the following style, for instance
>
>```erb
><ul>
>  <% @ratings.each do |rating| %>
>    <li> <%= rating %> </li>
>  <% end %>
></ul>
>```
>
> Also add the information about the total amount of ratings to the page.

At this point, the page should look more or less like this:

![picture](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/raw/master/images/ratebeer-w2-1.png)

The rating is rendered in a quite unpleasant way. This depends on the fact that the li element contains only the object name, because we haven't defined the method <code>to_s</code> which turns the ratings to strings, the method in use is the default <code>to_s</code> method which was inherited by all classes from the parent class Object.

In a second, we will define the method <code>to_s</code> for the ratings. Before doing in, we will first see a couple of things about object method definitions.

## A couple of clarifications about Rails model objects

Spend a second to inspect the class <code>Brewery</code>:

```ruby
class Brewery < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :beers
end
```

The brewery has a <code>name</code> and a founding <code>year</code>. We can reach them by hand from the console:

```ruby
irb(main):001:0> b = Brewery.first
irb(main):002:0> b.name
=> "Koff"
irb(main):003:0> b.year
=> 1897
irb(main):004:0>
```

Technically, <code>b.year</code> is a method call. For each column which is defined by the schema of the database table, Rails creates a field into the model object. It creates an attribute and the method to read and change the attribute value. These automatically generated methods look more or less as follows:

```ruby
class Brewery < ActiveRecord::Base
  # ..

  def year
    read_attribute(:year)
  end

  def year=(value)
    write_attribute(:year, value)
  end
end
```

The methods helps us to read and change the value of the object attribute. The method which changes the value does not yet implement the change in the database, which happens only when we call the <code>save</code> method, they are an example of 'getters and setters' which are generated automatically.

Outsite the object, we retrieve object attributes by using 'dot notation':

    b.year

What about inside the object? Create a method to demonstrate that attributes are handled inside brewery:

```ruby
class Brewery < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :beers

  def print_report
    puts name
    puts "established at year #{year}"
    puts "number of beers #{beers.count}"
  end
end
```
As it is in Java for instance, methods can be called with their name from within the object (<code>beers</code> is a method, too!)

You find an example on how to use the method:

```ruby
irb(main):001:0> b = Brewery.first
irb(main):002:0> b.print_report
Koff
established at year 1897
number of beers 2
```

You could have called the methods from inside the object by using Ruby's 'this,' that is, the object <code>self</code> reference:

```ruby
  def print_report
    puts self.name
    puts "established at year #{self.year}"
    puts "number of beers #{self.beers.count}"
  end
```

Create a method to 'restart' the brewery, in such case the establishment year changes to year 2015:

```ruby
  def restart
    year = 2015
    puts "changed year to #{year}"
  end
```

Try it out:

```ruby
irb(main):024:0> b = Brewery.first
irb(main):025:0> b.year
=> 1897
irb(main):026:0> b.restart
changed year to 2015
irb(main):027:0> b.year
=> 1897
irb(main):028:0>
```

as you notice, the year change does not work as we expected! As far as the method <code>restart</code> is concerned, there is no method call with <code>year = 2015</code>

    def year=(value)

There is no method call which could assign a new value to the attribute. Instead, a local variable called <code>year</code> is created in the method and it is given value 2015.

If you want to make the assignment work, you have to call the method through a <code>self</code> reference:

```ruby
  def restart
    self.year = 2015
    puts "changed year to #{year}"
  end
```
The functionality will not fulfill your expectations:

```ruby
irb(main):029:0> b = Brewery.first
irb(main):030:0> b.year
=> 1897
irb(main):031:0> b.restart
changed year to 2015
irb(main):032:0> b.year
=> 2015
irb(main):033:0>
```

**Attention:** In Ruby, instance variable are defined with an <code>@</code> character at the beginning. Instance variables _are not_ the same thing as the object attributes which are saved in the database thanks to Activerecord, anyway. The following code would not work as you could expect:

```ruby
  def restart
    @year = 2015
    puts "changed year to #{@year}"
  end
```

The <code>code</code> inside the brewery is an attribute which is saved in the database by ActiveRecord, whereas <code>@year</code> is an instance variable of the object. Instance variable are not used on Rails, actually. Instance variable are used on Rails only to transmit informatio from the controlers to the views.

> ## Excercie 3
>
> Create athe mehod <code>to_s</code> in the clss Rating. It should return a better sring form of the object, like "karhu 35" which contains the name of the rated beer, followed by its rating value.
>
> The folloing link might be useful to form strings: https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/blob/master/web/rubyn_perusteita.md#merkkijonot

After you have done the exercise, the rating pages should look more or less like this:

![picture](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/raw/master/images/ratebeer-w2-2.png)

Attention: when you create new code in your application, it is a good practice to make trials by hand in your console. Below, we try to use the default method <code>to_s</code> to return the value of the rating:

```ruby
irb(main):024:0> r = Rating.last
irb(main):025:0> r.to_s
=> "#<Rating:0x007f8054b1cb10>"
irb(main):026:0>
```

Now we will define a <code>to_s</code> method for the rating:

```ruby
class Rating < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :beer

  def to_s
    "written rating"
  end
end
```

and we try to run it again from the console:

```ruby
irb(main):026:0> r.to_s
=> "#<Rating:0x007f8054b1cb10>"
```

It looks like the change has not been implemented anyway, what is wrong?

In order to make sure the change of the code is implemented, you have to reload the new code in the console using the command <code>reload!</code>, then you should retrieve the object from the database again and use this one. 


```ruby
irb(main):027:0> reload!
Reloading...
=> true
irb(main):028:0> r.to_s
=> "#<Rating:0x007f8054b1cb10>"
irb(main):029:0> r = Rating.last
irb(main):030:0> r.to_s
=> "written rating"
irb(main):031:0>
```

As you see above, reloading the code is not enough in itself, because the object stored in the variable <code>r</code> contains the old code still.

> ## Exercise 4
>
> Create the method <code>avarage_rating</code> to the class <code>Beer</code> to find the avarage value of the beer ratings. Add the avarage value to the beer page __if__ the beer has ratings

>
>```erb
><% if @beer.ratings.empty? %>
>  beer has not yet been rated!

>```

The beer page should look more or less like the picture below, after you have done the exercise (notice that after last week, you could be showing the brewery ID instead of the brewery name on the page. If so, change your view so that it corresponds to the picture):

![kuva](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/raw/master/images/ratebeer-w2-3.png)

> ## Exercise 5

> Get acquainted with the methods <code>map</code> and <code>inject</code> (see for instance http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Enumerable.html#inject  http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Enumerable.html#map and google for further information) and change (in case you need) the method which calculates the rating avarage value so that it makes use of map or inject.
>
> Calculating the avarage value is easier in this case if you use ActiveRecord methods, see http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Calculations.html

If beers have no ratings, add one more rating to them using the console. The beer page should now look like the one below:

![picture](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/raw/master/images/ratebeer-w2-4.png)

The page has one small, but annoying grammar mistake:

    beer has 1 ratings

> ## Exercise 6
>
> Get acquainted with the auxiliary method <code>pluralize</code> which is ready made in Rails (http://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/TextHelper/pluralize) and use it to make sure the page beer page is grammatically correct (in case there is one rating, the method should print 'beer has 1 rating.')

## Form and post

Make it possible that ratings are created by hand in your application from the www-page.

According to Rails convensions, the form to create a Rating object has to be found at the address ratings/new, and the form can be accessed thanks to the <code>new</code> method of the ratings controller.

Create the appropriate route in routes.rb

    get 'ratings/new', to:'ratings#new'

Add the <code>new</code> method to the ratings controller (whose actual name is RatingsController). The method has to make sure the form is rendered. It looks simple:

```ruby
  def new
    @rating = Rating.new
  end
```

The method creates only a new Rating object and it passes it on the new.html.erb view template which is rendered by default through the method <code>@rating</code>. The object is created with a <code>new</code> command, which saves it into the database.

Create now the next view, the file /app/views/ratings/new.html.erb:

```erb
<h2>Create new rating</h2>

<%= form_for(@rating) do |f| %>
  beer id: <%= f.number_field :beer_id %>
  score: <%= f.number_field :score %>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
```

Go now to the page which contains the form, at the address http://localhost:3000/ratings/new

The HTML code which is rendered with the help of the view looks more or less like the one below (you find the code by going to the page and choosing _view page source_ from the browser):

```erb
<form action="/ratings" method="post">
  beer id: <input name="rating[beer_id]" type="number" />
  score: <input name="rating[score]" type="number" />
  <input name="commit" type="submit" value="Create Rating" />
</form>
```

As you can see, a normal HTML form is generated (you find more details at http://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/HTML/Training#Forms).

The address where the form is sent to is /ratings and the HTTP method used is not GET but POST. There are two fields which are numbers, and their values are sent to users with a POST call as values of the variables <code>rating[beer_id]</code> and <code>rating[score]</code> arvoina.

Rails method <code>form_for</code> creates a form which works correctly and sends the data to the right address automatically. The form has input fields for all the attributes on the object in parameter.

You can read more about how to create forms with the <code>form_for</code> method at the address
 http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#dealing-with-model-objects

If we try to create ratings, we get the error message <code>No route matches [POST] "/ratings"</code>, which means we have to create a route in the file config/routes.rb:

    post 'ratings', to: 'ratings#create'

According to Rails conventions, the method which is in charge of creating a new obect is called <code>create</code>. Make its foundamentals:

```ruby
  def create
    raise
  end
```

At this point, the method does not make anything else than throwing an exception (the method call <code>raise</code>).

Try to send information with the form, now. The exception thrown in the controller method causes an error message. Rails adds ample diagnostics in the error page, for instance the hash which is contained by the HTTP request parameters. The diagnostics looks like the one below:

```ruby
{"utf8"=>"âœ“",
 "authenticity_token"=>"1OfMRb9BTZzTnM5PfpFUupImkdIbLbwWi0FB90XBSqs=",
 "rating"=>{"beer_id"=>"1", "score"=>"2"},
 "commit"=>"Create Rating"}
```

The information sent with the form is contained within the hash.

The hash containing the parameters is saved in the controller variable <code>params</code>.

The new pieces of information about the ratings are the values of the hash key <code>:rating</code>, and we can retrieve them with the command <code>params[:rating]</code>. This is an hash itself and its vaue is <code>{"beer_id"=>"1", "score"=>"2"}</code>. In other words, you can retrieve the rating with the command <code>params[:rating][:score]</code>.

## debugger

Inspect the thing with the controller by hand, making use of Rails debugger.

If you have created your application with the Rails version 4.2, you will find that the debugger [byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug) is configured and available for use (there is also Rails web console which we will look a bit later).

If you have created the application with an older Rails version, add the following lines to the Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'byebug'
  gem 'web-console', '~> 2.0'
end
```

and execute the command <code>bundle install</code> from the command line. Restart your Rails application now by pressing control+c from the terminal where you are executing Rails and giving again the command <code>rails s</code>. **You should always restart the application if you set new gems.**

Add the command <code>byebug</code> to the beginning of the controller, at the point where you want to inspect the code.


```ruby
  def create
    byebug
    raise
  end
```

When you create a new rating using a form, the application stops in corrispondence to the <code>byebug</code> command. An interactive console view will open in the terminal where Rails is running:

```ruby
Started POST "/ratings" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-01-17 17:43:18 +0200
Processing by RatingsController#create as HTML
  Parameters: {"utf8"=>"âœ“", "authenticity_token"=>"ZsDeRgbMt4qOW3bB49hqHO7f0SHFfoAqADJMmjowwAs=", "rating"=>{"beer_id"=>"1", "score"=>"20"}, "commit"=>"Create Rating"}

[5, 14] in /Users/mluukkai/kurssirepot/ratebeer/app/controllers/ratings_controller.rb
    5:
    6:   def new
    7:     @rating = Rating.new
    8:   end
    9:
   10:   def create
   11:     byebug
=> 12:     raise
   13:   end
   14: end
(byebug)
```

The arrow tells you the command which is coming next. Analyse the contents of the <code>params</code> variable, now:

```ruby
(byebug) params
{"utf8"=>"âœ“", "authenticity_token"=>"ZsDeRgbMt4qOW3bB49hqHO7f0SHFfoAqADJMmjowwAs=", "rating"=>{"beer_id"=>"1", "score"=>"20"}, "commit"=>"Create Rating", "action"=>"create", "controller"=>"ratings"}
(byebug) params[:rating]
{"beer_id"=>"1", "score"=>"20"}
(byebug) params[:rating][:score]
"20"
```

You can execute whatever code from the debugger console as if it was a Rails console, in case you need.

The most important commands of the debugger might be step, next, continue, and help. Step executes the next step in the code, along with the possible method calls. Next executes the whole next line. Continue lets the program execution continue in the normal way.

More info about ByeBug at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html#debugging-with-the-byebug-gem


## Saving a rating

Inside the controller, <code>params[:rating]</code> contains all the information which is needed to create a new rating. Also, because it is a hash like <code>{"beer_id"=>"1", "score"=>"30"}</code>, it can be given straight as parameter to the method <code>create</code>. It should be possible to create a rating by using the command:

    Rating.create params[:rating]  # which means the same as Rating.create beer_id:"1", score:"30"

So change your controller code to look like the following:

```ruby
  def create
    Rating.create params[:rating]
  end
```

Try to create a new rating now. Against all our best hopes, the action fails and we are thrown an error message

        ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesError

What is it about?

If the command to create the rating had been

        Rating.create beer_id: params[:rating][:beer_id], score: params[:rating][:score]

which meens exactly the same as the form above because <code>params[:rating]</code> is __exactly the same__ hash as <code>beer_id:params[:rating][:beer_id], score:params[:rating][:score]</code>), we wouldn't have met any error message. Because of [information security issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_assignment_vulnerability) Rails does not allow "mass assignments" (that is to say, giving all parameters as hash) of a massive <code>params</code> variable when the object is created.

Starting from Rails 4, we have to specify what contents of the hash <code>params</code> we can mass-assign when we create the objects. For this, the controller uses the methods <code>require</code> and <code>permit</code> of <code>params</code>.

The idea is that first we use require to retrieve the hash which contains the information of the object which has to be created from params:

        params.require(:rating)

after this, we use permit to specify the fields where value mass assignment can be allowed:

        params.require(:rating).permit(:score, :beer_id)

Our controller looks like the following:


```ruby
  def create
    Rating.create params.require(:rating).permit(:score, :beer_id)
  end
```

More information on how to handle form parameters in the chapeter 4.5 Strong parameters at http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html 

Try now to create the rating. ATTENTION: when you use a form to create a rating, make sure that the beer ID input to the form corresponds to a beer ID which is available in the database!

Creating the rating works already (check it with the console of from the page of all ratings), but throws an error message, because by default the method tries to render the view template /views/ratings/create.html.erb which does not exist.


## Rederecting

We could create the template now, but we decide that the user browser is __redirected__ to the page containing all ratings after a new rating is created. Change the controller code to look like the one below:

```ruby
  def create
    Rating.create params.require(:rating).permit(:score, :beer_id)
    redirect_to ratings_path
  end
```

<code>ratings_path</code> is a path auxiliary method which is provided by Rails and it means the same as "/ratings"

If you have created ratings where <code>beer_id</code> does not reflect an existing beer ID, you will be thrown an error message. You can distroy these ratings by hand from the console (<code>rails console</code>) in the following way:

```ruby
    Rating.last        # shows the rating which has been created last, make that its beer_id is incorrect
    Rating.last.delete # removes the rating which was created last
```

You can distroy the beerless ratings also with the following "one-liner":

```ruby
    Rating.all.select{ |r| r.beer.nil? }.each{ |r| r.delete }
```

Select creates a table which will contain the collection items we have gone through if the option in the code chunk is true. <code>r.beer.nil?</code> returns <code>true</code> if the object <code>r.beer</code> is <code>nil</code>.

The command above can also be written in a shorter form like

```ruby
    Rating.all.select{ |r| r.beer.nil? }.each(&:delete)
```

What does the command <code>redirect_to ratings_path</code> exactly do when we use it in the controller? Usually the controller renders the appropriate view template, and the code retrieven is then returned to the browser, which renders the page on the screen.

When the browser is redirected, the server sends a response which is equipped with a statuscode 302, which does not contain any HTML at all. The response contains only the address where browser will automattically make the HTTP GET request. The redirection remains unnoticed for the browser user.

Try what happens if you put something like <code>redirect_to "http://www.cs.helsinki.fi"</code> as final redirection when a new rating is created</code>!

## redirect_to vs render

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get

Technically, it would have been possible to avoid using redirect and render the page with all ratings straight from the controller that creates the new rating:

```ruby
  def create
    Rating.create params.require(:rating).permit(:score, :beer_id)
    @ratings = Rating.all
    render :index
  end
```

Even though the result will look exactly the same for the website visitors, the solution is not the best for a couple of reasons. First of all, you have to copy in the <code>create</code> method all the code contained in the <code>inde</code> method, which is needed to form the view. Another reason concerns the browser use. If our controller rendered the page, and the browser user refreshed the page after creating one beer, the outcome would look like this:

![picture](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/raw/master/images/ratebeer-w2-5.png)

The browser asks the user whether it should send resend the form information because the last browser operation executed by refreshing is nothing but an HTTP POST which sent the form information. 
This problem does not exist with redirections: the page shown to visitors after the POST command is the page which is retrieven with the HTTP GET redirection.

The rule of thumb is that you should *always* use rederection when the controller handles HTTP POST methods for forms. This is true not only on Rails, but more generally in Web-programming, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get, with the only exeption if the controller operation does not work for reasons like the information sent with the form is uncorrect.

Let us underline this important different once again:
* when the controller method finds the command <code>render :something</code> (which often happens implicitely), your Rails application generates an HTML page, and the server sends it to the browser to be rendered
* when the controller finds the command  <code>redirect_to address</code>, the server sends a rederect question together with a statuscode 302 to the browser, requesting the browser to make the HTTP GET request to the address defined by the controller method. This happens automatically and the browser user will not notice the redirection

**Every** Web developer has to understand the part above!

## More about Rails applications debugging

A _web console_ has been built into Rails 4.2 by default and it works in the same way as the debugger. The console view opens automatically when there is an exeption in the program.

For instance, exeptions can be "cause" if you write <code>raise</code> in whatever part of the code, as we have done earlier on too. Let us go back to raise, in the rating controller method create:

```ruby
class RatingsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    raise
    Rating.create params.require(:rating).permit(:score, :beer_id)
    redirect_to ratings_path
  end
end
```

Now that you have created a rating, our well-known error page is rendered. At the bottom of the error page you will fine a console view, were you can execute Ruby commands in the exact same way as if you were using a debugger:

![kuva](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/raw/master/images/ratebeer-w2-9.png)

Exactly as it is when you use the debugger, the web console view opens in a context where the error happens. For instance, the variable <code>params</code> can be referenced, and we can also execute all the commands that could be executed by hand from the controller method, for instance, retrieve ratings from the database using the model <code>Rating</code>.

The web console is a useful tool, indeed. Unfortunately, the web console does not work too optimally in case of errors with the view templates, anyway.

Create a beer which belongs to a brewery, in your application:

```ruby
2.0.0-p451 :024 > Beer.create name:"crap beer", style:"lowalcohol"
 => #<Beer id: 13, name: "crap beer", style: "lowalcohol", brewery_id: nil, created_at: "2015-01-17 16:11:49", updated_at: "2015-01-17 16:11:49">
```
The value of the foreign key <code>brewery_id</code> of the object created in <code>nil</code>.

If you try to go to the page of all beers, you'll find an error:

![picture](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/raw/master/images/ratebeer-w2-10.png)

in the error message, you will find a line which tells us the problem and the problem cause:

    undefined method `name' for nil:NilClass

The view template tries to call the method <code>name</code> for an unexisting object. The irregular line contains the command

    beer.brewery.name

You are trying to call a method for an object which should be located in the field <code>brewery</code> of the view template local variable <code>beer</code>, but that object does not exist.

Differently then with the errors concerning controllers or the model, we do not have access to the view variables from our web console.

This is possible with debugger, anyway. We know that the error condition happens if a beer belongs to a brewery which is nil. Add the debugger starting command <code>byebug</code> to the view template to check the situation:

```erb
  <tbody>
    <% @beers.each do |beer| %>
      <% byebug if beer.brewery.nil? %>
      <tr>
        ...
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
```

This added the command to render the template as well as <code><% byebug if beer.brewery.nil? %></code>, which starts the bugger if the given condition is true. The command we used is Ruby's way to write

```erb
    if beer.brewery == nil
      byebug
    end
```

If you go to the page with all beers now, the debugger will start to work and you will manage to inspect the value of the local variable of the view template â€“ that is to say, the beer which caused the problem:

```ruby
[11, 20] in /Users/mluukkai/kurssirepot/ratebeer/app/views/beers/index.html.erb
   11:   </thead>
   12:
   13:   <tbody>
   14:     <% @beers.each do |beer| %>
   15:       <% byebug if beer.brewery.nil? %>
=> 16:       <tr>
   17:         <td><%= link_to beer.name, beer %></td>
   18:         <td><%= beer.style %></td>
   19:         <td><%= link_to beer.brewery.name, beer.brewery %></td>
   20:         <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_beer_path(beer) %></td>
(byebug) beer
#<Beer id: 13, name: "crap beer", style: "lowalcohol", brewery_id: nil, created_at: "2015-01-17 16:11:49", updated_at: "2015-01-17 16:11:49">
(byebug)
```

You can delete or fix object which caused our problem acting straight from the debugger:

```ruby
(byebug) beer.delete
  SQL (1.3ms)  DELETE FROM "beers" WHERE "beers"."id" = 13
#<Beer id: 13, name: "crap beer", style: "lowalcohol", brewery_id: nil, created_at: "2015-01-17 16:11:49", updated_at: "2015-01-17 16:11:49">
(byebug) c
```

With this, we deleted the beer and we continued the execution using the command <code>c</code>.

After you have fixed the problem, you should remove the debugger starting command from the view template.

Using the debugger is so useful, that you should get acquainted with it as soon as possible (and you should naturally get acquainted with Rails console too). The advantage of the debugger compared to Rails console in some situations is that you can open a debugger session in contexts you define yourself, for instance with the controller or with a view that has to be rendered. In this way, you can see what variable values there are in the program while you execute it.

Rails provides us with a [better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors) gem which works better than the web console in error situations connected to views rendering. Add the following item to the Gemfile

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem "better_errors"

  #...
end
```

Now run <code>bundle install</code> from the command line and restart your application. Create again a beer which does not belong to the brewery and go to the page with all beers.

Better_errors has modified the page which tells us about the error situation and it is now completely different:

![kuva](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/raw/master/images/ratebeer-w2-11.png)

You can have access to the view variables straight from better_errors console, and you will find immediately the erroneous beer.


## Path helper

Rails creates path methods (or path helpers) automatically to all the routes which are defined in routes.rb. Thanks to them, you will not need to hard-code the addresses of the various different pages.

For instance, the rederection address for a rating could have been hard-coded like the example below, instead of uding the auxiliary function <code>ratings_path</code>:

```ruby
  def create
    Rating.create params.require(:rating).permit(:score, :beer_id)
    redirect_to 'ratings'
  end
```

Hard-coding is unreasonable with addresses, as it is usually too.

The available paths which are generated automatically can be accessed from the command line, using the command <code>rake routes</code>

```ruby
âžœ  ratebeer git:(master) âœ— rake routes
      Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                   Controller#Action
       beers GET    /beers(.:format)              beers#index
             POST   /beers(.:format)              beers#create
    new_beer GET    /beers/new(.:format)          beers#new
   edit_beer GET    /beers/:id/edit(.:format)     beers#edit
        beer GET    /beers/:id(.:format)          beers#show
             PATCH  /beers/:id(.:format)          beers#update
             PUT    /beers/:id(.:format)          beers#update
             DELETE /beers/:id(.:format)          beers#destroy
   breweries GET    /breweries(.:format)          breweries#index
             POST   /breweries(.:format)          breweries#create
 new_brewery GET    /breweries/new(.:format)      breweries#new
edit_brewery GET    /breweries/:id/edit(.:format) breweries#edit
     brewery GET    /breweries/:id(.:format)      breweries#show
             PATCH  /breweries/:id(.:format)      breweries#update
             PUT    /breweries/:id(.:format)      breweries#update
             DELETE /breweries/:id(.:format)      breweries#destroy
        root GET    /                             breweries#index
     ratings GET    /ratings(.:format)            ratings#index
 ratings_new GET    /ratings/new(.:format)        ratings#new
             POST   /ratings(.:format)            ratings#create
```

For instance, the last 3 routes tell us the following things:
* the method call <code>ratings_path</code> generates a link to the address "ratings" which is directed to the <code>index</code> method of the ratings controller.
* the method call <code>ratings_new_path</code> generates a link to the address "ratings/new" which is directed to the <code>new</code> method of the ratings controller. This will render the rating form.
** Attention: as you see if you compare the routes above, <code>ratings_new_path</code> is not the same as the creation path for new beers, for instance, we will correct the problem later
* The POST call to the address "ratings" is directed to the <code>create</code> method of the ratings controller

As we have already noticed, in Rails 4 the information of the command <code>rake routes</code> arrives to the web page to render even in error situations. The page even provides you with an interactive tool, which you can use to see how the application routes the input example path:

![picture](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/raw/master/images/ratebeer-w2-6.png)


> ## Exercise 7
>
> In the page with all ratings, add a link to create a new rating. Add a link to the list with all ratings in the navigation bar of your application.

## Beer selection from a list

Creating a new rating is not the nicest thing to do now, because the user has to know the beer ID. Change the rating so that the user can choose the beer he wants to evaluate out of a list.

If we want that the form to create a new rate was able to build a list, the form should be handled and shown to users by the controller, which has to retrieve the list from the database and save it into a variable. Extend the controller in the following way:

```ruby
class RatingsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @rating = Rating.new
    @beers = Beer.all
  end

  # ...
end
```

If you consult page http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#making-select-boxes-with-ease and make a couple of trials, you will find out that the form to create a rating has to be modified in the following way:

```erb
<%= form_for(@rating) do |f| %>
  <%= f.select :beer_id, options_from_collection_for_select(@beers, :id, :name) %>
  score: <%= f.number_field :score %>

  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
```

This means that the value of <code>beer_id</code> of the form is generated with the select element of the HTML form. You can select the options of this element using the view method <code>options_from_collection_for_select</code> from the list of beers contained by the <code>@beers</code> variable. When you do it, make sure that the beer ID is taken as value and that the beer name is shown to the form users.

**Attention:** you can test the view methods from the console too. The methods can be called through the <code>helper</code> object:

```ruby
2.0.0-p451 :026 > beers = Beer.all
2.0.0-p451 :027 > helper.options_from_collection_for_select(beers, :name, :id)
 => "<option value=\"Iso 3\">1</option>\n<option value=\"Karhu\">2</option>\n<option value=\"Tuplahumala\">3</option>\n<option value=\"Huvila Pale Ale\">4</option>\n<option value=\"X Porter\">5</option>\n<option value=\"Hefezeizen\">6</option>\n<option value=\"Helles\">7</option>\n<option value=\"Punk IPA\">11</option>\n<option value=\"Nanny State\">12</option>"
2.0.0-p451 :028 >
```

> ## Exercise 8
>
> Create the method <code>to_s</code> for your beers so that the text will show both the beer and the brewery name
>
> Modify the form to create ratings. Users should not see the value of the name field of the beers they will choose from; instead, they should find the string of text which is returned by the method <code>to_s</code> of the object.

> ## Exercise 9
>
> Do the same change to the form to create beers (in the file views/beers/_form.html.erb) and to the controller which takes care of showing the form (beers#new). The user should not have to define by hand the brewery of the beer he wants to create, but he should be able to choose the brewery out of a list.
>
> Change the controller to create new beers (beers#create), so that the browser is redirected to the list with all beers after a new beer is create. The list address should be generated with a path helper. By default, the browser should be redirected to the page of the new beer with the command <code>redirect_to @beer</code>: implement this.
>
> The form created autometically by Scaffolding contains the code for reporting errors, and we will get acquainted with this better later.

> ## Exercise 10
>
> By this time, the style of the beers created are given as strings. We will change our application later on so that the beer styles are also stored in the database.
>
> Before we do it, adopt a temporary solution. Change your application so that the style of the beer created can be chosen from a list, which is built based on the table supplied by the controller.  The code of the <code>new</code> method of the beer controller will be modified as follows:
>
> Kontrolleri
>```ruby
>  def new
>    @beer = Beer.new
>    @breweries = Brewery.all
>    @styles = ["Weizen", "Lager", "Pale ale", "IPA", "Porter"]
>  end
>```
>
> The view will have generate the selection options of the form based on the <code>@styles</code> table. Instead of using the method <code>options_from_collection_for_select</code> to generate the selection opetions, you had better use the method <code>options_for_select</code>, see
> http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormOptionsHelper.html#method-i-options_for_select

Strangely enough, after all this changes you will not be able to edit the beer information. The reason is that the view template which generates the form is the same view template which is used to create a new beer and to edit the beer information (app/views/beers/_form.html.erb). After the changes, the view will require that the variable <code>@breweries</code> contains the brewery list and the variable <code>@styles</code> contains the brewery styles. You can access the page to modify beer information after executing the controller method <code>edit</code>, and you will have to modify the controller in the following way to fix the problem:

```ruby
  def edit
    @breweries = Brewery.all
    @styles = ["Weizen", "Lager", "Pale ale", "IPA", "Porter"]
  end
```

It is very typical, that the controller methods <code>new</code> and <code>edit</code> contain much of the same code. It might make sense to extract the same code and make a new method out of it.

##  REST and routing

REST (representational state transfer) is an HTTP-protocol-based architecture model which is expecially used to implement web-based applications. The idea behind it is simple: the resources for editing and retrieval are defined by addresses, the request methods describe the operation for the resources, and the request body contains the data for the resources, in case they are needed.

Read now http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html till the point 2.5. Rails makes it easy to observe a structure such as REST. If you are interested in it, you can read more about REST from 
[here](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-restful/), for instance.

Change the rating paths to the file routes.rb so that we can use, so that we use the <code>resources</code> definition which is already defined:

```ruby
  # comment or remove the old definitions
  #get 'ratings', to: 'ratings#index'
  #get 'ratings/new', to: 'ratings#new'
  #post 'ratings', to: 'ratings#create'

  resources :ratings, only: [:index, :new, :create]
```

Because you don't need routes like **delete**, **edit** ja **update**, use the <code>:only</code> qualifier to choose only the routes you need. Take a look at the paths defined for the application by running the command <code>rake routes</code> from the command line (or from the web page with an erroneous URL):

```ruby
     ratings GET    /ratings(.:format)            ratings#index
             POST   /ratings(.:format)            ratings#create
  new_rating GET    /ratings/new(.:format)        ratings#new
```

The result is the same as the one before, but the name of auxiliary method <code>rating_new_path</code> follows now Rails conventions and it's called <code>new_rating_path</code>.

Change the old path method call which is used in the template app/views/ratings/index.erb.html with a new one.

## Removing a rating

Add the possibility to remove ratings. First, change routes.rb and add the appropriate route:

    resources :ratings, only: [:index, :new, :create, :destroy]

Then add a link in the ratings list to delete the ratings:

```erb
<ul>
  <% @ratings.each do |rating| %>
    <li> <%= rating %> <%= link_to 'delete', rating_path(rating.id), method: :delete %> </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

Rails conventions imply that you delete objects using the HTTP DELETE method. If want to delete a rating where the ID is 5, you can do it by clicking the HTTP DELETE call to the address ratings/5.

As we have mentioned before, the parameter of <code>link_to</code> can be the object which is called instead than the call <code>rating_path(rating.id)</code>. The code above can also be shortened to:

```erb
<ul>
  <% @ratings.each do |rating| %>
    <li> <%= rating %> <%= link_to 'delete', rating, method: :delete %> </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

In order to make it work, you have to define the method <code>destroy</code> for the controller, which executes the deletion.

The URL to the method is ratings/[the ID of the object to delete]. According to Rails conventions, the method finds the ID of the object to delete thanks to the <code>params</code> object. The deletion happens when the object is retrieven from the database and its <code>delete</code> method is called:

```ruby
  def destroy
    rating = Rating.find(params[:id])
    rating.delete
    redirect_to ratings_path
  end
```

A redirection will be executed at the end, which leads back to the page with all ratings. Because of the redirection, the browser sends a new GET request to the application for the /ratings address, and the method ratings#index is executed again.

> ## Exercise 11
>
> Deleting ratings has an issue: if users are not too delicate they might eventually destroy ratings without meaning to do it.
>
> Take a look at the model in the template of the page which lists all beers (/app/views/beers/index.html.erb). Make it so that users are required to confirm whether they really mean to destroy a rating.

## Orphan objects

If you remove beers with ratings from your application, the ratings which belong to the deleted beer remain in the database. Obviously, this causes that the rating page renders erroneously.

> ## Exercise 12
>
> Remove some beers with ratings and go to the page with all ratings. You will see the error message <code>undefined method `name' for nil:NilClass</code>
>
> The error is cause by the fact that it tries to call <code>beer.name</code> from the method <code>to_s</code> of the rating object.
>
> Delete the orphan ratings by hand from the console. Try to think first of a command/some commands, which can help you to make a list of the orphan ratings. If you can't think of it yourself, you can find a ready-made answer for the exercise above in this page.

The ratings which belong to a beer can be deleted easily and automatically. Together with the beer model code <code>has_many :ratings</code>, you should mark that ratings are dependent on beers, and that they should be destroyed if beers are distroyed:

```ruby
class Beer < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :brewery
  has_many :ratings, dependent: :destroy

  # ...
end
```

The orphan issue is solved now.


> ## Exercise 13
>
> Implement the same change for the breweries. When a brewery is deleted, its beer should also be deleted.
>
> Create a brewery with at least one beer with ratings. Delete the brewery and make sure, the beers of the brewery and their ratings are deleted.

## Inderect object connection

Your application is created in a way so that ratings belong to beers and that beers belong to breweries. This means that a set of ratings belong to each brewery, indirectly. Rails provides you with a simple way to go from the breweries to the ratings directly by hand:

```ruby
class Brewery < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :beers
  has_many :ratings, through: :beers
end
```

the connection is defined as a "database connection," but it is specified that the connection happens through other beers. Now the brewery has the method <code>ratings</code> which returns the ratings.

Implement this connection in your code and test the following thing from your console (not before doing <code>reload!</code>):

```ruby
2.0.0-p451 :033 > k = Brewery.find_by name:"Koff"
2.0.0-p451 :034 > k.ratings.count
 => 5
2.0.0-p451 :035 > k.ratings
 => #<ActiveRecord::Associations::CollectionProxy [#<Rating id: 1, score: 10, beer_id: 1, created_at: "2015-01-17 13:09:31", updated_at: "2015-01-17 13:09:31">, #<Rating id: 2, score: 21, beer_id: 1, created_at: "2015-01-17 13:09:33", updated_at: "2015-01-17 13:09:33">, #<Rating id: 3, score: 17, beer_id: 1, created_at: "2015-01-17 13:09:35", updated_at: "2015-01-17 13:09:35">, #<Rating id: 10, score: 22, beer_id: 1, created_at: "2015-01-17 15:51:02", updated_at: "2015-01-17 15:51:02">, #<Rating id: 11, score: 34, beer_id: 1, created_at: "2015-01-17 15:51:52", updated_at: "2015-01-17 15:51:52">]>
```

> ## Excercise 14
>
> Change the page which shows the information of the singular breweries so that it tells the amount of ratings of their beers as well as the avarage value. Add the method <code>average_rating</code> to the brewery to do this.
>
> Make sure the count for the number of ratings is grammatically correct, as it was in exercise 6. If there are no ratings, do not show the avarage.

The brewery page should be look more or less like the picture below after you have implemented the changes. (The beer list in the picture has been modified with the ul element to make a bullet list; also, we have removed the 'back' link which was created by scaffolding. You can implement these changes in your code too:

![picture](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/raw/master/images/ratebeer-w2-8.png)

You will see, that beer and brewery both a method called <code>avarage_rating</code> which also works in the same way. You can not leave the code like this.

> ## Exercise 15
>
> Ruby provides you with a way to share methods between two classes with the help of modules, see https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/blob/master/web/rubyn_perusteita.md#moduuli
>
> Modules have different uses â€“ namespaces, for instance. However, now we are interested in the _mixin_ collection which can be implemented with modules.
>
> Get acquainted well enough with modules and refactor your code so that the method <codee>average_rating</code> in moved to a module which is contained by the classes <code>Beer</code> and <code>Brewery</code>.
> * place the module in the lib folder
>* Attention: go to the file <code>config/application.rb</code> and add a line to the definition of the class <code>Application</code>: <code>config.autoload_paths += Dir["#{Rails.root}/lib"]</code>. This line will make Rails load the module code so that it can be used by the application classes. **You will have to restart Rails server (and console) after adding the line**. This is because Rails reads (or executes) the configuration files only when it is started and their changes are not taken into consideration real-time (differently then the application code).
> * Attention 2: if the name of your module is <code>RatingAvarage</code>, exactly like in the example, because of Ruby naming conventions it has to be place in the file <code>rating_avarage.rb</code>. In fact, even though classes names are CamelCase and start with capital letters, their files names follow the snake_case.rb style.

After you have done the exercise, the class Brewery should look more or less like below (assuming your module is called RatingAvarage):

```ruby
class Brewery < ActiveRecord::Base
  include RatingAverage

  has_many :beers
  has_many :ratings, through: :beers
end
```

and the method <code>avarage_rating</code> should still work like before:

```ruby
irb(main):001:0> b = Beer.first
irb(main):002:0> b.average_rating
=> #<BigDecimal:7fa4bbde7aa8,'0.17E2',9(45)>
irb(main):003:0> b = Brewery.first
irb(main):004:0> b.average_rating
=> #<BigDecimal:7fa4bfbf7410,'0.16E2',9(45)>
irb(main):005:0>
```
If your application contains a model, which is only used in the modules, it should be placed in _app/models/concerns_ rather than in the directory _lib_. The code contained in the directory is loaded by default to be used by modules, so you will not need the variable <code>config.autoload_paths</code>. You will have to add the definition <code>extend ActiveSupport::Concern</code> to the modules in the directory app/models/concerns.

```ruby
module RatingAverage
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  # ...
end
```

Because the modules we have defined are only used in the models, the concerns directory would have been a better location to store them. Move your module to the right place, if you want.

## A simple protection

At the end of the week, you now want to make your application in a way so that only the administrator is allowed to delete breweries. In week 3, you will use a more far-reaching way for autentification; implement a shortcut now, using [http basic access suthentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). See http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/HttpAuthentication/Basic.html

At the same time, you can get to know Rails controllers _filter methods_, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#filters. You can use them to implement easily a particular functionality, so that some particular methods are executed before (before_action) a defined controller.

Define a filter method called <code>authenticate</code> for the brewery controller (which is defined as <code>private</code>). The filter has to be executed before each method of the brewery controller:

```ruby
class BreweriesController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_brewery, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
  before_action :authenticate

  # ATTENTION: never write the private definition in a file before controller methods (index, new, ...)

  private

  def authenticate
      raise "toteuta autentikointi"
  end
end
```

The filter method throws an exeption. Therefore, you will be sent an exeption every time you go to whatever page of the breweries. Check this out in the browser.

Define the filter method execution so that it affects only when breweries are deleted:

```ruby
class BreweriesController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_brewery, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
  before_filter :authenticate, only: [:destroy]

  # ...

  private

  def authenticate
      raise "toteuta autentikointi"
  end
end
```

Check again with your browser that other pages work, but deleting a brewery causes an error.

Implement http-basicauth authentication then (you can read more at http://blog.dcxn.com/2011/09/30/the-simplest-possible-authentication-in-rails-http-auth-basic/)

Hard code an "admin" user name with the password "secret":

```ruby
class BreweriesController < ApplicationController
  before_action :set_brewery, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
  before_filter :authenticate, only: [:destroy]

  # ...

  private

  def authenticate
    authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic do |username, password|
      username == "admin" and password == "secret"
    end
  end
end
```

And your application will work as desired!

ATTENTION: After you have given the right user name and password, the browser will not ask for the ID when you go to the page again. Open a new incognito window, if you want to test the sign-in process again!

The idea behind the method <code>authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic</code> is that the application requests the browser to send a user name and password. These are later forwarded to the code chunk between <code>do</code> and <code>end</code> through the parameters <code>username</code> and <code>password</code>. If the code chunk is true, the page will be shown to the user.

HTTP Basic authentication is useful for the pages simple protection needs. In more complex situations however, you will have to look for other solutions to provide better data protection.

You'd better note, that the HTTP Basic authentication should not be used for other purposes than the HTTPS protocol, because user name and password are sent [Base64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded. This means that anyone could get to the headers and find out the password. A solution which is slightly better is the [Digest access authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication). In this way, users sign in with an identifier which is calculated with a private function and not with user name and password. Using Digest authentication is simple on Rails, see 
http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/HttpAuthentication/Digest.html

> ## Exercise 16
>
> Expand the solution so that the program would accept other user name-password pairs which are hard coded. The available IDs are hard coded in hashes which are defined in a method. The method has to work hashes which contain IDs of arbitrary length.
>
>```ruby
>   def authenticate
>    admin_accounts = { "admin" => "secret", "pekka" => "beer", "arto" => "foobar", "matti" => "ittam"}
>
>    authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic do |username, password|
>      # do something here
>    end
>  end
>```
>
> If you test the functionality, remember that you have to use an incognito browser if you want to sign in again after giving the right combination of user name and password already once.

## Problems in heroku

To end your week, it is time to deploy again your application in heroku.

If you try to naviage to the page with all ratings, you will find the old evil error message:

![picture](https://github.com/mluukkai/WebPalvelinohjelmointi2015/raw/master/images/ratebeer-w2-12.png)

Tracing down errors when the application is running in the production mode is always a bit more difficult than when it is running in the developer mode, where Rails provides the application developer with various ways to find out the problems.

In the production mode, the problems reason has to be found from the application logs. As we mentioned last week already, you can find heroku application logs with the command <code>heroku logs</code>.

Once more, you'll find the reason of your problems:

```ruby

```

The *ratings* database table does not exist. The problem is solved if you execute the migrations:

    heroku run rake db:migrate

Next you will generate a situation where your database will be put in a slightly inconsistent condition.

Start heroku console with the command <code>heroku run console</code> and create a beer which does not belong to any brewery

```ruby
irb(main):002:0> Beer.create name:"crap beer", style:"lager"
=> #<Beer id: 4, name: "crap beer", style: "lager", brewery_id: nil, created_at: "2015-01-17 17:58:43", updated_at: "2015-01-17 17:58:43">
```

and create a beer which belongs to an inexistent brewery (meaning that the reference key brewery ID is erroneous):

```ruby
irb(main):003:0> Beer.create name:"shitty beer", style:"lager", brewery_id: 123
=> #<Beer id: 5, name: "shitty beer", style: "lager", brewery_id: 123, created_at: "2015-01-17 17:59:50", updated_at: "2015-01-17 17:59:50">
irb(main):004:0>
```

If you go now to the page with all beers, you will find the same naughty message "We're sorry, but something went wrong.". Once again, you will find the error by looking into the logs:

```ruby

```

Here is the cause:

    undefined method `name' for nil:NilClass

The line which cause our problem is

    <td><%= link_to beer.brewery.name, beer.brewery %></td>

There is a beer whose <code>brewery</code> field is <code>nil</code>. This can be because the value of the beer <code>brewery_id</code> is either <code>nil</code> or erroneous (in case of a brewery which has been deleted).

After you have found the reason, you'll have to find the culprit. Open your heroku console with the command <code>heroku run console</code> and retrieve the beers without brewery:

```ruby
irb(main):006:0> Beer.all.select{ |b| b.brewery.nil? }
=> [#<Beer id: 4, name: "crap beer", style: "lager", brewery_id: nil, created_at: "2015-01-17 17:58:43", updated_at: "2015-01-17 17:58:43">, #<Beer id: 5, name: "shitty beer", style: "lager", brewery_id: 123, created_at: "2015-01-17 17:59:50", updated_at: "2015-01-17 17:59:50">]
irb(main):007:0>
```

The next thing to do is fixing the objects which cause the problem. Because you created them yourself a moment ago for testing reasons, delete the objects (first store into a variable the objects returned by the previous operation which are in the variable <code>_</code>):

```ruby
irb(main):007:0> bad_beer = _
=> [#<Beer id: 4, name: "crap beer", style: "lager", brewery_id: nil, created_at: "2015-01-17 17:58:43", updated_at: "2015-01-17 17:58:43">, #<Beer id: 5, name: "shitty beer", style: "lager", brewery_id: 123, created_at: "2015-01-17 17:59:50", updated_at: "2015-01-17 17:59:50">]
irb(main):008:0> bad_beer.each{ |bad| bad.delete }
irb(main):009:0> Beer.all.select{ |b| b.brewery.nil? }
=> []
irb(main):010:0>
```

Most commonly, the problems we have in production depend of the inconsistent state that some beers have got because of our changes in the database scheme. For instance, they may be belonging to objects which do not exist or the references might be missing. **It is a good practice to deploy the application in the production mode as often as possible**, in this way, you will know that the potential problems are caused by the changes you have done and fixing them will be easier.

Because it is a program in production, resetting the database (<code>rake db:drop</code>) in never a good way to "fix" a database inconsistencyk because the data in production cannot be destroyed. You should start from the beginning to learn reading logs and finding out problems as you are meant to do.

## Returning the exercises

Commit all your changes and push the code to Github. Deploy to the newest version of Heroku, too.

You should mark that you have returned the exercises at http://wadrorstats2015.herokuapp.com/courses/1 (you can mark them after Monday)
